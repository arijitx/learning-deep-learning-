All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.,Jesus Christ.
Sooner or later that's everybody.,Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.

You got that?,No, I don't get that!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.,Did you hurt her?
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!,Milos.  Get my money!

Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?,Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
Two more.,Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
It's the last one.,Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.,I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
You probably also know that we found them okay.,Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.,Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Well, don't worry about it.,And don't you worry about it.

Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon,Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?

Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?,I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.,How can you tell it was deliberately buried?

You're gonna help us take him.,No chance.
Yeah.,It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?,Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Luther was part of the gang?,What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Hey, this works pretty good.,Thank you.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.,If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.,Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Now, where we goin', convict?,Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.

He's after your money.,You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?

You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.,Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...,If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.,What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.,Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?,Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
Yeah, I see her.,I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.,Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.,I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
You okay?,Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.,Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.

Thanks.,No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.,Yeah, I read the report...
What the bell happened?,I lost them, that's what happened.
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...,The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?,Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
Tell me that's not the same guy.,Hey ... Dick Tracy.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?,Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
I got to wait for a call.,Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
I don't think your gun's loaded...,This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
I'm all wet.,What's wrong with that?
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.,What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?,Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?,Jack?  What was that?
How do you know?,Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...

What're you laughing about?,Napoleon... small.
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?,...Why on earth do the stones interest you?

Who are you?,I brought the girl remember?

...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.,Three of us will never fit in there!
Apipoussan?,Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Uh...,...Hoppi-hoppa.
I'm so very sad.,Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
...Like love...,Exactly.
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?,Uh..
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.,Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..,Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?,Wonderful!
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..,"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.,Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?,Got it.
How's our deal coming along?,Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!,...I can't wait to be among you.
Okay, I believe you.,We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.,Honey, I'm not, please...
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?,I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
What are these?,Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
What are you talking about?,The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
Bullshit.,I'm telling you...
What the fuck... !,I promised him to Machine.
A fellow investor.,Hmm.
What's the problem?,I'm camera shy.
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.,Look, I don't know what this...
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?,I remember him.
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...,How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
... sorry...,First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?,You betrayed us.
I figured you share information.,We do.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.,You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
What's he talking about?,One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
Don't ask questions.,Fuck you!
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.,Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?,It was a lot of fucking money.
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.,Something like that.
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.,What did you do with her body?
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...,Stop talking.
Do it.,Don't think I won't.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?,Easy enough for you.
Look, you cocksucker...,Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
Big date tonight?,Yeah... guess so.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.,I'll risk it.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.,Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?,Max.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...,There's not much illegal.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.,How much?
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.,What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
Where are your parents?,I don't know, where are yours?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.,Specialty product.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...,Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.,It's their Presidential Suite.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?,It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
Wha... ?,Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil.","Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
What's this?,It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?,Thank you.
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.,I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
Pittsburgh?,Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
It won't work like that.,Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
Okay...,My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
Okay.,Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?,I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.,They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?,No.
I didn't mean to...,You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
I had to ask.  I apologize.,No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?,Of course.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.,What?
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.,It's been six years.
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...,No... no... no...
What is this?,Those are her belongings.
Kincaid and Joey died last night.,What?
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?,It was bad.
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.,Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?,Sounds like a game show host to me.
You've been up all night?,That obvious, huh?
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...,"In her dream"?
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!,Kristen's story really got to her.
Not really.,Is there something we can do?
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.,Then what else can we do?
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.,It's okay, we're just about there.
Here we are.,Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Hey, Rick!,Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?,She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
So?,It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Nice neighborhood.,Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
Hey man, we're all sorry...,She knew she was gonna die.
Feeling better now?,Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --,What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.,You're not taking my baby!
Is that who you're waiting for?,No...
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?,Who said I...wait, what?
Mommy...?,Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
Where is he?,He's inside you, where he hides.
What do you mean?,It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
Dad!,It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
Thanks for everything, Dad.,You sure you don't want a ride to work?
I'm so sorry, honey...,Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
Since when are you such a smart shopper?,Since my little girl became a mom...
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.,Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?,There aren't any little boys on your floor.
Did everyone call everyone?,They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?,I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.,Krueger is reality.
Are you alright?,Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
You do good work, Alice.,So did Dan.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.,Well we gotta do something!
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...,I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
Then get out!,Mark!
Where are you going?,I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
I don't understand.,She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?,Next life.  Oh, what's that?
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.,You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.,Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
It's okay.,Stick around, please?
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.,It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
You could train someone else.,Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!,<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!,You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -,I'd sooner swim!
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -,<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.,So?
Cyclops?,Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!,You know - it <u>is</u>?
You hear that?,The sound again?
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.,Right, Skipper.
Is there any way out of it?,Seems to be all around...
What course, Skipper?,Right at our one-eyed friend!
Skipper - could you take a look here...?,Something wrong?
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!,Wonderful!
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?,<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.,Who with?
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?,Huh?
What do you think?,I think I should have joined the Air Force!
He did!,I am afraid not.  Therefore -
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?,On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Why?,I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
See what?,The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
Well, I'll be - !,I'll be another!
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?,What is the Northcountry Development Association?
What are you boys up to?,Same old shit.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?,Tell me.
I plan to. Soon.,How soon?
Guaranteed, eh?,Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
If you get it?,Yeah.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.,You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
They said.,Hmm.
Safety on?,Yeah.
This way.,Sun's gettin high.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.,How'd you get the job?
On your sleeve.,Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.,Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
But it's not funny now.,It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.,Yes.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?,No.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?,Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.,I want to go home.
That's illegal, you know.,I know.
Tomorrow, Gordon.,Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
You don't want the extra police pay?,I'm not saying that.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.,You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.,You want me to follow them to Littleton?
How you holding up, Wade?,I'm fine, fine.
Lillian!,Where's Jill?
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?,Yeah.
She's grown up some, hasn't she?,Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?,No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We should talk.,We've done all our talking, Wade.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.,See you tomorrow, maybe.
I'm sorry.,I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
You don't mean that.,Yeah. I mean that.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.,There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.,The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
I can see what you looked like as a kid.,You knew me as a kid.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?,I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?,The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Strange.,Think they're alright?
What happened?,Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
It makes me sad.,Can --?
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.,How's that?
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.,Yes. Here's your ticket.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.,This town sucks.
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?,Sleeping.
You remember Margie Fogg?,From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.,We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Yeah.,I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.,Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!,You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?,Love! I'm made of love!
Call it what you want.,Everything you know is from me.
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!,I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Rolfe.,Wade?
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.,Who?
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.,What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.,Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Then who shot him?,Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.,They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?,Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.,Well, I never heard that one.
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?,Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.,Alice...
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.,They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
Do you see the maintenance panel?,Got it.
It's cut.,cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Uh, we got a problem here.,Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.,Lemme take a look.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.,Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.,An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
But they start executing hostages in,I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.,Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.,Roger.
How many others killed?,Nine.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.,Well it worked.
*                     Please tell me your name.,Maria... Maria Mitchell.
What do you know of my husband?,I know he left you behind.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.,That was war.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.,Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.,Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
May I speak to you for a moment?,Can't it wait?
I don't know why you stayed.,Please... don't start with me.
The fax machines.,Excuse me?
Yeah, right.,Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.,You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.,This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
It's bait.  Don't take it.,Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.,Yes, sir.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.,You better check it, Unger.
Elaine.,Te...!
Ted, what's wrong?,Ask Simon.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.,You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.,Who's that, Ted?
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.,Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.,What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!,Set!
Ted, the lever!,Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.,Is that a good sign, Doctor?
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.,Simon.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.,And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.,Don't be too long.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.,I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.,No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.,Negative.
That's not possible.,Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.,I don't want to hear that word!
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.,All right.  Here.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.,What?
You folks need any help?,Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.,Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
Striker.,Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
Ah, won't you sit down?,Thank you. Cream?
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?,No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.,Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
What's his problem?,That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!,Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!,That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.,It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
See them, Elaine?,Uh-huh.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.,You promise you'll write.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.,Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
How ya doing, honey?,Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!,I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.,...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
Oh, I'd love to.,Okay, this is one of my favorites.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?,I will, but Jim won't.
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?,Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Roger.,Huh?
We have clearance, Clarence.,Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?,No. No thank you.
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.,Would you go up, please?
You are Cassandra?,That's right.
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.,Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.,You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...,No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.,This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.,Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?,Yes.
Well... yes, quite possibly.,Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Nothing?,Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.,And still it fits?
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.,How the hell do you know that?
Back off, George.,But I-- .
Tell me.,Your mother mates out of season.
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.,Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
I believe he is probably lying.,Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.,No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
She's going to divorce me.,George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.,You must leave me alone on this.
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!,No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?,... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.,I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--,Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.,It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
How do I look?,You look very good.
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.,What is it?
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.,Only holds five.
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.,I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?,Sure.  Just a minute.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?,You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
Granger and Pitts are already on it.,Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Does that look at all suspicious to you?,Whatever gave you that idea?
You got your vest?,Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Get outta there!,I can't!  Do you mind!
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?,Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.,Yes.  That follows.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?,Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...,You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Amy.,Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.,Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
No.  There's no way!,Hear me out...
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...,No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?,Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.,Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --,They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.,Corporal Hicks!?
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.,You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.,But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.,It's insured.
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.,Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!,Shut up.  Just shut up!
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...,Sir?
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.,Alive?
What's this?,Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.,The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
Ellen.,Don't be long, Ellen.
Sounds like you, Hicks.,The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Looks like it stung him.,Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.,How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.,Think of what?  We're fucked.
Range twenty meters.,Seal the door.
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.,They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.,How long have I been on Gateway station?
Cross my heart.,And hope to die?
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.,You're really something, ace.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.,I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Yes, there are, aren't there.,Why do they tell little kids that?
Yes.  A little girl.,Where is she?
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!,Newt, wait!
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.,I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?,Indeed.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.,His Grace is very angry with you.
Maestro.,Good morning.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?,Yes.
What's that?,A brothel.
How was I? Tell me honestly.,You were sublime.
Hardly.,Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
Humiliated?,How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
Don Giovannnnnnnni!,Who the devil are you? What do you want?
Now?,Yes!
No!,Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
I think you're mad! You're really mad!,Oh, leave me alone.
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?,Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
I don't know.,Well, ask her!
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.,Wolfi.
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!,Wolfi! Your father is dead.
What?,Your father is dead.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.,Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Excellency!,Madame. How can I help you?
Frau Mozart?,That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
These are originals?,Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
Alone.,What for?
Some service deserves service in return. No?,What do you mean?
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.,Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
How much will you pay him?,Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.,Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.,I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
Really?,Ah, now! Here she comes.
Just one year.,Who was your teacher?
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!,Yes?
Do you like this, Salieri?,It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Yes, where?,In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?,Yes, indeed.
What do you mean, Sire?,Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.,Enchanted, Madame.
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?,Well, yes, I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?,Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.,Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Why are you here?,Am I not welcome?
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.,Is she not here?
Do you always live like this?,Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
Pupils?,Yes.
Yes.,How many?
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.,Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Father -,Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.,Really? What is it he's writing?
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.,Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
I think I've found out about the money, sir.,Yes what?
Is he working?,I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Sssh!,Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Well?,Sublime! Utterly sublime!
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.,German!
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?,No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.,Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
No.,Why not?
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.,Well, we can.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.,Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!,Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?,Really?
How could I not?,It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
So you are. How is your pretty wife?,She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.,Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!,How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
Do you have a daughter?,I'm afraid not.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?,Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.,I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?,I think it's marvelous. Truly.
Mozart. It was good of you to come.,How could I not?
Yes?,I never knew that music like that was possible.
What happened? Is it over?,I'm taking you home. You're not well.
No, please.,I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.,Finish what?
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?,Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.,Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
Strange!,Come. Let's begin.
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -,Please! Just one moment.
With the tenors.,Also identical?
And that's it. Do you have it?,You go fast!
Do you have it?,Yes.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.,I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Oh? Have I seen it?,I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
Then why especially does it have to be in German?,Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.,But, Your Majesty -
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?,Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.,Mozart -
About what?,You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!,My son, no one can speak for God.
What?,His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.,Italian?
You mean that play?,Exactly.
He's setting that play to music?,Yes.
Oh yes, yes. And that was?,Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Well, promise then.,What do you mean - now?
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?,No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.,Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.,Who is she?
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?,Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
Can I be of service, Miss Price?,Dr. Hirsch?
Go about your duties.,Yes, Doctor.
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.,Come to my office, Miss Price.
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.,Yes, sir.
He's not?,Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.,Has his friend appeared to him again?
Dr. Hirsch?,Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
It was a wolf.,What?
I'm afraid you have to eat something.,Please, really. I'm not hungry.
Aw come on, Miss Price!,Call me Alex.
Aw come on, Alex!,Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Do you like it?,I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
How old are you?,That's not really a very proper question.
I'm twenty-seven.,I know.
What? Oh, yes, please.,A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Hello. You all right?,I'm sorry I woke you up.
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.,Will you come with me?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?,Not just a patient -- me.
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?,Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
But, David.,I wasn't hallucinating.
Anything.,Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?,Don't you remember?
David, what are you doing?,Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
We had an argument. He's being silly.,I swear, I don't know this girl.
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!,David, don't lose control.
How are we feeling tonight?,No.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.,You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.,What are you going to see?
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.,The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!,Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
Lunatic?,Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?,I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.,Did you see Jack?
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.,Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Are you cold?,Yes.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?,I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?,I don't know.
Nice looking group.,Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!,Apparently so.
What the hell was that all about?,I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.,I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
What do you think was wrong?,I have no idea.
Did you hear that?,I heard that.
Could be a lot of things.,Yeah?
The Hound of the Baskervilles.,Pecos Bill.
Heathcliffe.,Heathcliffe didn't howl.
No, but he was on the moors.,It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
Nice doggie. Good boy.,Walk away, Jack.
It sounds far away.,Not far enough. Come on.
Jack?,Yeah.
Where are we going?,I'll tell you when we get there.
You really scared me, you shithead.,Are you going to help me up?
Thanks a lot.,This is too much. I can't handle this.
David! You're hurting my feelings.,Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.,Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.,Rudy Levine the shmuck?
What?!,David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
I'm not listening!,On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
Shut up, you zombie!,I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!,The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
What are you doing here?,I wanted to see you.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.,David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
Get out of here, Jack!,David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
Jack, are you really dead?,What do you think?
Dr. Hirsch?,Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
You were saying?,Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Excuse me.  Yes?,Roger Mathison, Doctor.
Hot chocolate?,We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!,Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.,She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
No kidding?,No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Charlie!,Yeah?
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?,Aw, nerts!
Where you been?,Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
I remember once when your account checked.,Yeah.
And tell him not to delay.,Yes, sir.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!,Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything,I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?,Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!,We've been waiting fifteen minutes
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.,Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Oh!,You understand?
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.,All right, Jack, all right.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?,They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!,Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
Fifty thousand dollars!,But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?,Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?,She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.,I'm sorry, Dude, butI
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?,You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
know, but,Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
Doesn't that come next?,Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.,Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
Well, what?,Well, aren't you going to invite me?
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.,No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
No.,I want to be near you!
Let me see your cash book, will you?,Now?
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.,This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.,Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?,Tomorrow night?
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?,Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?,In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
I don't know.,Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Why - well, I,Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!,Where is he now?
In Mr. Sampson's office.,Now don't you worry about it.
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?,Numbers? No, never mind.
Yes?,Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.,Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
You haven't got a uniform?,No, sir.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?,Why, I don't know.
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?,Yes, sir.
It's all right. Thanks.,And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?,I can't tell you.
No. I won't.,You're protecting somebody.
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?,Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.,Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson
What time did this thing happen?,The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?,No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.,What'll we do?
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.,All right, dear.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?,Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?,Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?,Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it,That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
So you were home last night?,Yes.
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .,Then where were you?
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.,Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Everybody in?,I guess so.
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!,They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
This is healing?,Sometimes a wound will kill.
Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.,Zee, I'm pleased you came.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.,Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
Uhh, yeah it does.,You stay out of this, Bob.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.,How?
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.,I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.,Oh no...
The Army can hang him.,Tomorrow.
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk.",Hey!
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...,One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
She had a moustache.,She was European!
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.,It was exciting.
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.,Yeah.
Jesse, we got to have a word.,Sure, cousin.
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.,Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
It'll be the biggest score yet.,What will be?
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.,If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!,Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --,Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.,You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!,You ride like a Comanche.
I think one of 'em's glass.,Which one, right or left?
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --,Strategically.
The safe. Now.,Of course!  Uh, sir?
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!,All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?,Ho-yah!
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.,So?
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.,Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
"Big and older"?,You can shut up now.
You are a charmer.,I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.,Ma.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.,Don't care.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.,Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --,And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.,And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
This has been a good year.,Jesse, we're outlaws.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.,A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
We're drunk.,Oh yeah.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.,Yeah.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?,I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.,See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.,Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
Doc Mimms will --,Shush.
You shouldn't be up.,I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
You're sick of my company?,No! I mean, of course not. No.
Teasing you is completely unfair.,What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.,I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.,You didn't want to farm?
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.,Me neither.
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?,When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
Zee.,Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?,Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
You almost ended my career before it began.,Pity.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?,Last February?
Yes?,The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
Was it worth it?,Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.,He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
Now let's have a drink.,Right here in church?
Jim, you been with a girl yet?,Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?,I swear.
Thank you, Miss -- ?,Lyla Devereux.
Really!,NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
The final route for the railroad is complete.,I look forward to seeing it.
Parker.,Sir?
That.,Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
You wouldn't have done that?,Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.,So you can't tell me anything?
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.,All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.,Can you put men at all four?
I can't.,I'm thinking Dorsia.
You like it there, don't you?,The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Okay. Yeah. What time?,Eight?
This is Dorsia?,Yes, dear.
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.,Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
Luis is a despicable twit.,Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
Pull out.,I'm ignoring you.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.,Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?,Maybe.
What are you doing tonight?,Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...,I never knew you smoked.
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?,Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
Get married. Have a wedding.,Evelyn?
We need to talk.,Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.,But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .,What are the rules for a sweater vest?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.,Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?,Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
Can I help you?,I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
Are you sure?,You saw the ad in the Times?
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?,Yes, naturally.
Excuse me. I really must he going.,No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer,But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?,Lucky, I guess.
Patrick? Is that you?,No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Call me please, Patrick.,Jesus lives, Luis.
SHUT UP!,Calm down. Let's do it anyway
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.,But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...,Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.,Ask me a question.
I said we are totally booked.,Two at nine? Perfect.
Oh, something. . romantic?,No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
Yes, Patrick?,Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
That is...if you're not doing anything.,Oh no. I have no plans.
Anywhere you want?,Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.,Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.,You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.,No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
Do you have a boyfriend?,No, not really.
Patrick Bateman's office.,Jean? Hello? Jean?
Patrick? Is that you?,Hello? Jean, I need help!
Where are you?,Jean-I'm not-
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.,Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Patrick? I can't hear you.,What are I doing?
Welt...it depends, why?,Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.,No. I really don't.
Who?,Paul Owen.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?,No.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.,Does he do this all the time?
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.,No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL,Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
KIMBALL.,Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Well, what's the topic of discussion?,The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?,Shoot.
Your address?,Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?,He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.,I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Where did Paul hang out?,Hang...out?
So was I.,Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
Actually, yes.,Hmmm.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...,Oh.
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?,What?
That's so typical, isn't it?,It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
So...you hang out here a lot?,Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.,Wait. That's not what I've got.
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.,Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?,Great, yes, I'd like that.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.,Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
No hash browns?,Not in the mood, I guess.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?,Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.,But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
I lost my job...,Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?,I'm not...
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.,I'm hungry.
Listen, what's your name?,Al.
Shhhh...it's okay.,Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.,Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.,Yeah, well, you're late.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.,We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?,They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
You think so?,You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.,C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
What!,Teddy was killed last night.
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.,I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.,Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.,...Whaddo I do?
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.,...Why?
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.,Milo, you --
Right. Wait. A toast.,You're just afraid to eat it.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.,Prick.
My goodness.,It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.,You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
Okay.,Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
What?!,Wanna be a part of history?
Is it your software?,Is it your dish?
We could move 'em up here.,He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
...Hello?,Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
You know a lot about art, I guess.,There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.,Low enough to relay internet traffic.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?,Skywire.
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.,That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Milo. What's up?,Well -- you sent for me.
Had you talked to him much lately?,Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...,34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.,The wrong place?
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.,...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
You could've handwritten it.,I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
This is good. Who did it?,'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
What'd the girl say?,There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
Longitude 109 --,Wait... He knows.
Gary?,Just do it.
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?,Cool.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?,...Something like that. Yeah.
Did I say something?,No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
Cool!,Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
I snuck into #21.,Why would you do a thing like --
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.,The Day Care?
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.,They'd frame him.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.,Before they kill somebody else, too.
Does he know you know?,He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?,It's three years old, it --
...He knows.,What?
Latitude 47 degrees.,Wait a second. He knows I know.
Wanted to say goodbye to him...,Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
Maybe he'll get back to work.,Speaking of which...
What is it?,Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?,What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
May I wash you?,Groovy.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?,Is it about my teeth?
Hungry.,Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
Where am I?,You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?,The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?,We won, Austin.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?,No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.,Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...,Yes?
She's working on another lead right now.,Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Hello, Exposition.,Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.,Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--,Yes Basil?
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.,Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.,Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.,Excuse me?
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.,I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!,Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.,Here, use mine.
I can't see a bloody thing.,Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
I don't get it.,Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Fancy a nibble?,I couldn't have another bite.
I haven't had fun like that since college.,I'm sorry.
You're smashed, Vanessa.,I am not.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?,Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
No, did you use a condom?,Only sailors use condoms, man.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?,Do you think she's prettier than I?
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.,I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.,Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
What do we do now?,We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
I'll hurry back.,Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
Austin, what's your point?,Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
Austin, I'm coming with you.,I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
Danger Powers, personal effects.,Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
Here, have a piece of gum.,Here, have a piece of gum.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.,What are you saying, son?
Oh my God, he's back.,In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.,Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
Ahhhhhhhhh!,Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?,Yes.
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.,My son?
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.,It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
Hi.,Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.,I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.,People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
What about his teeth?,You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Did you ever...,Of course not. I was married to your father.
Did you ever want to?,Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.,No need. I'll call again.
... death ...,Love...
Hope...,... love ...
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?,Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?,Eh? In here!
People, too.,Then who wins?
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...,Hmmm ...
My number two. Special assignments. She's --,Let me guess -- 'Father'?
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.,After the cold war ...
I resign.,You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.,So am I.
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...,Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
An unholy trinity ...,You killed my husband.
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...,Too many cooks --
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.,Valentine, listen to me ...
That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...,You're mad.
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.,How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
Choices?,I'll never marry you.
I was about to throw in the towel.,I had a spot of bother at the door.
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.,A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
Steed, we really must be --,Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?,Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
But why? What's the point?,A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?,As per mother's instructions.
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?,Small talk.  Try the weather.
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.,Why should they think that?
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?,Did you say formal? I must dress.
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?,I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...,She had this in her mouth. There, there...
That's what we were working on.,Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
Steed ... !,Mrs. Peel ... ?
I could save you the trouble.,No trouble.
Because you always obey orders ...,Always.  Except ...
But you did suspect me.,Not for a moment.
I thought you played by the rules.,I thought you didn't.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?,Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.,Why's he called 'Invisible'?
What is it?,Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...,You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -','... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...,Have you any place in mind?
Our chaperon.,Pity your mother came, too ...
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.,Decontamination -- ?
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.,Peter's brother?  But --
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.,Who's now vanished.
I was getting to it.,Getting to what?
Mother. I thought you were burglars.,Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Weather's turning nasty.,You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.,Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
Why?,She may try to kill you.
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.,How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --,Guilty until proven innocent?
In your operation.,I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?,Ugh ...
I've decided not to run for President.,Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Man, you're losing your audience.,Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
All right!,When do the girls get to the party?
And...,Bond... James Bond.
I don't want any trouble.,Oh, come on, just a little.
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.,Fan out and look for them.
Hello?,Mr. Thomerson.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?,Yes I did.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.,I've tried to change her mind.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?,What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.,Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.,Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
Cole?,Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...,You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.,I'm going now, Cole.
What are we having?,It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.,Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.,I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?,Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
Huh? Wha...,I can't sleep.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...,I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
That feels so great.,Good...
Um... that's very relaxing.,Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.,I am committed. I love you.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?,Yes...
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?,Ilene, Rick promised...
A strange wang right in my palm.,Ilene, we don't really know that.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.,Quiet, Mother.
I hope Ilene's all right.,I hope those guys are all right.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?,A real turd.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.,Let's see your bread.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.,They'll be up there in a half hour.
It's true.,This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
Hookers beat you up?,Yes.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.,No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?,I couldn't find any razor blades.
Are any of those right?,This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
You're all under arrest. Open up!,Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
Welcome, welcome, one and all.,Rick!
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.,No. Let's at least finish the set.
You've been having strange sex...!,No, Brett, I...
What the hell is that?,My gift to you.
Under the table!,The best table in the house.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.,Oooooo.
How 'bout this?,Still drawing a blank.
Now, don't get into any trouble.,Take care.
How about this, a Trojan donkey.,And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
Reach out and snort someone.,I'm saved. Let's party!
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.,Who?
You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.,Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.,Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.,Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
Can you believe how perfect it fits?,Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
Wash it to the windows?,No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?,No.  I need a drink.
You gotta let me finish --,Just come down, John. Just --
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?,I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.,Not likely.
Sheep don't count.,Yeah? What about Laura --
Why'd you come here, Brian?,I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.,Thanks for the speakers.
Hey.,Hey.
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.,C'mon, let's crawl home.
...Not now, Brian.,Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
Hey, what are you doing here?,Just... Just wanted to say hello...
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.,You're selling dad's boat?
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...,I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
Brian.,Jennifer.
I work for city hall.,Really? No kidding.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.,Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.,Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.,C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
You think that's really any of your business?,Well, you did invite me here.
Thanks for the invite.,Got anything to drink in there?
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.,Then why did you quit?
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.,Uh huh.
Brian. What's wrong?,You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --,Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?,Yes.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?,Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
I'm sorry.,That's a dumb thing to say.
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.,I don't have a story.
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?,What?
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.,The outlets.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.,Trychticholorate.
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.,You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
I want another shot, Sir.,Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --,-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.,I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
Where are you going?,Pest control.
Read.,"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.,And the putty around the door?
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier,But the right guess on this is arson.
I don't guess.,Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
What the hell are you doing here?,I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?,Fire.
Just wondering.,I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?,Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.,No need to be modest, Brian.
Every little boy's fantasy.,Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
Aren't you even curious?,Engine 115, right?
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.,It's in my blood, Willy.
Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.,And DIE!
Firehouse.,Cute.
He just wants to --,-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
We gotta roll, Stevie...,I'll be there.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?,He's going to be a fireman.
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --,-- You remember.
Yeah? When was the last time?,In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.,Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
Shadow.,How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
Who's this?,He works for me.
Knock it off. Now.,Tell him about me, Shadow?
-- Burn them.,And old ladies?
I'm working on it.,I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
It knows us. This one knows us.,I need that report, Lt.
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?,Just catch the son of a bitch.
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!,Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.,They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.,I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...,You mean you could use it.
I forgive you.,Me?
I want 15 on the Mets.,How about 7 1/2?
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?,I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.,This psycho can.
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.,You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.,How 'bout...
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.,B-L-A-K it is.
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?,YEAH!
You don't have the demographics.,So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.,My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.,What's your name?
We're ready when you are.,Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
What do you do?,I'm a revolutionary.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.,Meaning?
I'm out.,Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
My tap shoes.,EUREKA!!
How different?,Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
Do you know what C.P. Time is?,C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.,I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.,I'm wid it.
The name of the show?,It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?,I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
That's a great handle.,Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.,Exactly!
Yep, you guessed it.,This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?,In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!,We think so.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?,I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?,Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!,Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.,We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.,I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
What do you want?,I want to speak with you.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.,Where do you go from here?
I love you too, Daddy.,Always keep 'em laughing.
He never showed it.,He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
Nobody told me anything.,What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.,The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
We both lied to him.,What do you want me to say?
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.,Light?
This is crazy.,That's why it will be so much fun.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.,The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
Yes, your name?,He, I'm Mona.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.,Same thing Giuliani said.
No joke.  Serious.,Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?,Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.,If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Mommy, please don't call me that.,Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.,I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
Peerless, your father called.,I'll be right over.
Regardless, he still is your father.,It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?,Soon.
This is a TV show, not a music video.,Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.,Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.,We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
You sing and dance?,A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.,I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.,You tellin' the truth.
Not her, the one with the little...,Oh her.
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?,Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
...yes she did.,...I heard different, thought that was...
I slept too near where I fell out.,You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
I don't know who I am.,Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
A lot?,Enough.
Oh you do, huh?,Just a little something' somethin'.
You're sure this is a good idea.,My people love me.
What?,You look beautiful like that.
How did you get this gig?,Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
And?,And what?
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.,Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?,Only a very little, as soldiers do.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?,Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?,Your cousins go out with him.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.,I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?,Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
I have no luggage.,The gentleman has nothing contraband.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?,Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?,Yes, sir.
Who else can give me information about you?,Only the agency of servants.
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.,I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?,I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?,Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.,Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.,That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?,Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Will we always leave it at this?,Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.,Agreed.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?,I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
By name only.,Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
Then this must be done tomorrow.,What is to be done?
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.,I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.,Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
Sir, let those laugh that win.,I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.,Tender Hegenheim.
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.,You know that was like a quadruple negative?
Bill Styles...,Who?
Don't you ever point a gun at me!,I'm -- I'm sorry...
Did -- did you --,It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?,We don't know. West is dead.
You too?,We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!,That son of a bitch.
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.,Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
And he'd been shot.,Yeah --
We don't need the tapes --,Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.,And the bodies?
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?,Epilepsy.
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.,We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Cadet, what's your name!,Sir, Dunbar, sir!
He wouldn't kill anybody...,Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Jesus, what happened?,West... he's dead.
So you killed him?,I...
Whose blood is that, Jay?,West's. Any kindling for afire?
What do you mean, West's?,I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
You know it's not like that --,Do I?
Right?,Yeah...
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --,You're the only one missing a grenade.
Why... why didn't you tell me?,Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.,You saw West, right? How was he killed?
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --,No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?,Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.,Mr. Hardy?
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.,My heart weeps.
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --,So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?",Well?
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --,I didn't do anything --
Why?,Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --,I'm not gonna let that happen.
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.,There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Yeah.,Does Osborne agree?
Hostile and uncooperative.,Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --,Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
He's in interrogation?,Yes.
Is Dunbar cute?,That is the most unprofessional --
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.,Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
We're in the middle of a murder case --,Best time for banal chit-chat.
You're off to a late start.,So noted.
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.,Got it.
That was kid gloves?,Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.,And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
Buttfucks the cabin?,And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.,You wanted to get the truth.
So what now?,Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
We were close to something with Kendall.,Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
No.,Good, just making sure.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.,Right back where we started.
That's not true.,There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
You're a good man, Hardy.,Really.
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.,Think it'll work?
Nah.,Want company?
How?,Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
I don't think I want to hear this --,Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
Maybe we shouldn't go.,The faggot speaks.
He said what?,"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
No one else heard it?,He whispered it in my ear.
Dunbar says you were.,Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
What happened with Nunez?,He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --,Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --,The fuck are you talking about --
You think he did it?,No --
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!,Sir, yes, sir!
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!,Sir, yes, sir!
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.,That's great.
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.,I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.,Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.,No one's ever left.
You won't find a better place!,I don't expect to.
You get the eye?,I brought it.
Will.,Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?,I suspect it will hurt a lot.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.,I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
Really.,You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.,Stop.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.,Oh, so this is a tall tale?
Karl.,Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
What did she say?,Beats me.
You're not trying to run away?,Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
Jesus Christ.,Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
You --  -- are in for a surprise.,Am I?
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...,Did you do any of that?
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.,You mean, while I'm here.
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.,What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
Tell me how it happens.,How what happens?
Wait! I need those!,There is no softer ground than town.
Oh. Oh.,Hello.
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.,We'll have to pick up a copy.
I'm going to get started on dishes.,I'll help you.
I'm going to check on him.,I need to lie down for a bit.
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.,You're not.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?,He's up with your father.
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.,Really! That's wonderful.
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me 150.,What for?
Yeah it was okay.,Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.,There's over eighty thousand here.
What?,You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
What? What are you doing?,What are you doing here?
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.,Leave him!
And...,And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
Hold on.,Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
Right.,We better watch him. He's crazy.
What was that?,I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
Binoculars.,Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
What was that?,Oh nothing.
Do you believe in love?,I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
He wants a lot of money.,I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.,I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?,Yes.
Syevodnya?,Syevodnya
They go. John. They go.,What's wrong?
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.,You don't understand anything.
So what are you going to do?,I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.,No I don't.
What?,I said I don't have any.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...,I don't want to talk about him.
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.,He will come back.
Shut up. I'm not listening.,You don't want to talk about it.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.,Thank Christ for that.
I don't have nothing.,Well what have you got?
Are you scared?,Not really. Maybe a little.
What happened between you and the blonde?,What?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.,It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?,She's dead.
She's alive!! She is not dead?,Laugh it up.
I don't know.,What was her name?
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?,No. I think I better just go.
Okay. Goodbye.,Goodbye.
Something else.,Okay. Promise?
It's not mine.,It's not mine either.
It's a long way to go for a date.,Tell me about it.
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.,Right.
Is the flight full?,I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
What are you doing?,Just wanted to see.
Then start taking them seriously.,Yes, ma'am.
Angela?,Yes?
I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.,You didn't have to do this.
This was very sweet of you.,Well. Hope you enjoy it.
Hey.,Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...,Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
He black alright, he just ain't blue.,Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.,You seen my snake-skin shoes?
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.,Can I put it in your mouth?
Sit down, man. Need a beer?,Sure.
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.,She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...,That's not right, really, cuz I...
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.,I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
You gonna steal my truck?,Make yourself at home. You done it already.
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?,It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.,I begged him not to go. And he did.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?,Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.,Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.,And you gonna live it with him?
Better than what you give.,Rose... please...
God forgive you, for how you done me...,Let go...
GODDAMMIT, RAE!,BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!,Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.,Don't need none.
How you let men treat ya like they do?,What?
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?,Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.,What do you want?
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...,In my house, you watch that lip...
Now you get up! And you get in my house!,Or what?
My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!,Let go of me...
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?,Uh-uh.
If you want... I can take you back to town now.,I ain't in a hurry.
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.,I'm here with you.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.,No one's gonna hurt you no more.
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.,Word wit'cha. In private.
What'chu sayin'?,What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.,What'chu sayin'?
You ever seen a train run on a woman?,Nuh-uh.
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.,Ain't gonna be moved?
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?,Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
The hell is this shit?,What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
You won't at the square this mornin'.,Get me ten bags of mulch.
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.,Why she got a chain on her?
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.,Please don't tell my daddy.
Thank you.,I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.,Rae don't do this now...
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!,Rae!
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.,Are you wasted?
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --,-- I should tear your head off.
Frank Abolofia.,The Wolf?
Nick, have I been a good partner?,Number five with a bullet.
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.,I didn't know.
Let's go.,Nick, we can't just --
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.,Let's grab some food.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.,He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Squid?,Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
Joyce can be nice.,What'd she say?
Short shift?,Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
Are you expecting anyone?,I wasn't expecting you.
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!,What's the problem here?
Nick!,Give us a break...
It's Ichiro.  Ich.,Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
What happened?,They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.,Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.',No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
Did I say that?,You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Nick...,If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
Yakuza.,Good.  Very good...
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --,You can trust me.
Because he knows how to get to our man.,He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
You did great, Ichiro.,I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
Thank you.  You have one?,A wife.  She left.
What's that for?,Luck.
Think we'll get him, Nick?,We can't lose.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.,I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
Don't be an ass.,He's on duty.
You'll get Ich killed.,No one's keeping him here.
This is my stop.,I'm amused.
One guy do all the damage?,Yeah.
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.,What...?  What if I say no?
It's not your job.,He was my partner.
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!,I planned on catching him, Captain.
We're police officers.,You're foreigners.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.,Look.
You had my help, detective.,If anything happens to her while I'm here --
I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.,I want him.
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.,The Feds would be onto you in a month.
If I say no?,You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
Let's go while there is still time.,Where?
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.,Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
And what can he do for you?,Can the maker repair what he makes?
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.,Why?
Why are you staring at us?,You're just all so... so different.
We have a lot in common.,You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.,Of course not.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?,Dr. Tyrell?
Where are you going, Sebastian?,Just thought I'd...
I was just about to have my dinner.,If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
She was gonna get away.,Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.,Yeah.
Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.,Got it.
Well, when do you get paid?,Soon as I finish the job.
When might that be?,Day after tomorrow.
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.,I know all that.
Prosit.,Prosit.
Those cockroaches?,Ya.
How long you had these guys?,Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
Nerves of steel.,No rust?
You're going to be over the limit.,Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
Yeah?,I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.,I don't know nothing about it.
It's a good job.,You mean the snake.
The best.,Does it eat?
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.,A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.,Ugh.
Is there anything else?,I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
I've already got more help than I need.,I think you need more help than you've got.
Two of us might be more effective than one.,I work alone.
I can imagine.,Can you?  I couldn't.
You ever take a bath with a man before?,There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
I told you I'd come back.,You did?
This feels stupid.,Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?,You mean a woman?
Ten years.,Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.,What difference will it make?
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?,No.
But in your profession that is a risk.,Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
Well?,If she is, the machine works.
How many questions did it take?,Thirteen.
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...,What one?
But I understand what you mean.,You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?,We sure did.
Oh, now, that's a great one!,You like it?
Bravo!,Thank-Q!
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.,How do you do?
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.,Come where?
Let's go talk first, Adam.,Yes, ma'am.
Please excuse this interruption.,Oh, brother...
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?,Shallow? I'm shallow?!
Get out of here!,No, you get out of here.
Where are we going?,We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
No, I'm lost.,You're lost?
It was amazing.,Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.,Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
I think it's the eyes.,The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
What?,Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.,How long would you need me?
What's fair?,I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
Who are these people?,My Mom and Dad.
Very funny, smart ass.,Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
They're all divorced?,Everybody's divorced.
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.,That's what I was afraid of.
You almost got us killed!,I told you I've never driven before!
I was wrong!!,Is this your house?
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?,He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.,Thank-Q!
In the house?,No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
May I please be excused?,Uh...yeah.
The guy with the underpants!,That's boring!
About clothing?,Yeah.
No!  Not crazy!,Do I look crazy?
I thought I was here to meet women.,Not that one!
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.,Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?,Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.,You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
I don't blame you!,Eve, I'm sorry.
Uh-huh. Adam?,Yes, Eve?
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.,Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
My pleasure.,It was at least as good as the sky.
Really?  Okay!,And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.,...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.,Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.,They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!,Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
These are wonderful.,It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
Like one of Mom's?,Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!,Blow out the candles!
C'est bon, Monsieur.,Merci!
Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore.",Adult Bookstore.  Why?
But, I don't understand.,And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
That's what everybody believes?,Yes, sir. It's true.
When did we get it from them?,1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!,Sorry, that's the largest city.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.,True.
Why not? He has great pants.,I just don't want to.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.,Almost all of them.
What?!,Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.,Okay. Thank you, my friends.
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.,I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?,Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
What?  What is it?!,The sky!!!
I don't see anything!,Just look!!
Say what?!,How do you do, ma'am.
I do alright.,Good!
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?,I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Elbows, Son.,Sorry, Mom!
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.,I'll go up.
Right.,I just hope this is still good up there.
Yes?,I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.,Yes, ma'am.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.,A psychiatrist?!
Oh, my God!,He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.,What about relatives?
Good god.,Yeah.
Really?,Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
It shuts off automatically.,Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
You hear that?!,Yes.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?,Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!,No, Calvin, you're favorite.
I've noticed.,What shall we call him?
Why?,No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Let's eat our cake.,Yeah. Let's dig in!
Yes.,I don't believe it!
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.,Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We stay down here.,We do?
And the ocean!  A mountain range!,--do as I say!
How long will you set it for this time?,I thought ten years.
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...,Some time.
You came back for these?,Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.,Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
Stop it, you two!,I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
Well, what do you think?,I think...it...works.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!,Eve?!
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.,Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Go to the bathroom.,Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
He go back to the hotel?,Uh..he might of.
Or have perfect table manners.,You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?,You're goddamn right I am!
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!,I know...I know. You did the right thing.
Gay.,Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
And if we can't find him?,We'll find him.
Buy it from me?,Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
Tower, say again!!,The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.,Roger, Wolf One.
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.,Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?,Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.,Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
See you Tuesday, Frank.,Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.,You did? A human ear?
Is that why you say it's horrible?,Yes.
Why do you do it?,I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
What color is it?,It's blue. Blue velvet.
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.,Yeah.
Okay?,Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?,I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Who knows you have these?,Only you and the photo lab.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!,Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?,Nobody.
Shit. You better tell me something.,I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?,Well.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.,No. Come on.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?,Nothing. Are you alright?
Do you like the way I feel?,Yes.
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?,Do you know?
No.,You don't?
No. What is happening?,Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.,That's not crazy. I like you too.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.,There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?,Kiss me.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!,Just get outta my bed.
I didn't mean to hurt you.,Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
There's no disease, I can tell you.,Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I guess I should go.,I want you to stay with me.
They hurt his head.,Who, Dorothy?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.,Oh he forced you, huh?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.,No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Look at these. What are these?,Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it.,Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  Hey, pretty, pretty.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.,Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
On a ride.,A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?,This is it.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.,Alright.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.,Yeah. okay.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.,Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Well.,I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
Are you feeling okay?,Uh-uh.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?,Yes.
What else is new? Right?,Yeah. What are you doing now?
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?,I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?,Maybe so.
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.,Where are they?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.,Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
What will I say when she comes to the door?,You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?,Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.,You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.,Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Brilliant.,Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.,It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?,Yeah.
Okay, thanks.,I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.,Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.,I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.,I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
Okay, okay.,Goodnight.
What am I going to do?,You want to go talk to him?
Shoot.,Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.,Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?,Yeah.
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.,Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Everything okay?,Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
It's good to see you.,Where to?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?,I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
You want to dance?,I can't dance fast.
Really?,Really. You want to dance with someone else?
My father has a gun at home.,No.
Jeffrey? What's going on?,Shhh. I'll tell you.
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.,No Jeffrey!!
Come on out a minute, okay?,Okay.
Fuck you.,Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.,Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.,Yes mother.
Look under the body.,Got it.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?,Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.,Any tips on where these guys may be?
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!,Where's your gun?
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!,Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?,He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!,What happened?
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.,MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.,No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
You guys?,We're here brother.
Hello.,Connor, is that you?
Yeah, we promise.,Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?,We paid attention in school.
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.,Be careful.
We're alive.,An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?,Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?","I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.,Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
I don't know they just always need it.,What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.,Just like on TV.
Where the fuck are you going?,We'll find it. Just calm down.
Who did you kill?,Holy shit. Who? How many?
So what do you think?,I'm strangely comfortable with it.
Give the guy a shot.,Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.,And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.,Okay then... let's get ya started.
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?,Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
So, what do we do now?,That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
She was in here when it went down.,Can she I.D. them?
Maybe the three of them had something in common.,No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
What?,Where's my cat?
The what man?,The fat man.
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.,Why was I not informed of this?
What the...?,I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
Oh my god!,I...
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.,Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
What are you serious?,Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.
No. You sure you're okay?,I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.,Well, what'ya do?
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.,Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
Well he sure as fuck knew you!,Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.,We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
Hello? You there?,Y-Yes my son.
I guess not.,It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
You're right.,Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
Have you no fear of God?,That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?,Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.,Yeah boss?
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.,I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
OK. That's wrong.,Dignan, it's --
Where are you going?,I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
How was I ridiculing you?,You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.,That sets it off.
Calm down. Take a deep breath.,You're right. You're right.
What about what that guy said?,Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
What's wrong with him?,What do you think?
What about them?,They obviously weren't designed for racing.
OK. Go ahead.,On your marks...  Get set go.
You owe me fifty bucks.,Bob?
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.,No. We didn't.
Where was I?,You were asleep.
He told you and you let him do it.,He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.,If you say so.
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.,I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --,I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.,Shh.
That's what she is!,I know that. But --
Who's in the car?,That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
You could give somebody a concussion.,Let me feel that.
Next week we'll be drinking pia coladas.,Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
You're all clear.,Roger.
You're kidding.,Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
There's not enough time.,Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
Like amnesia.,Can't remember shit. CRS.
You got to be kidding me.,I'm not kidding.
You think Applejack knew?,We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
How big is it?,Oh, I'd say about --
Where?,Behind Bob's house.
Does it float?,We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.,It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
Congratulations. You passed the test.,What do you mean?
But you're thieves. It's what you are.,Yeah.
Did you ever steal a car before?,Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
Could you grow cinnamon?,I don't know. Sure, I guess.
How long are they going to hold him?,I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.,Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Were you adopted, Bob?,Why do you say that?
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?,God, yes. Like silk.
What?  What?,Like silk?
Nice to meet you, Applejack.,You're Anthony?
Yeah.,I hear you're a good thief.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?,Uh-uh.
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.,What do you mean?
That's Anthony.,That's your friend Anthony?
Wait. Did he see us?,We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
You don't celebrate til it's over.,True.
What?,Bob! Get back in position!
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.,I don't know about that.
No.,I thought your parents were in Italy.
You stole a Trans-Am.,Yes. I did.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?,Good question.
What did I say?,I told you he's crazy.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.,No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
I think we might of scared her.,Let's just go.
I'm going to take a look at this.,Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.,That's too bad.
What happened?,Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?,He wouldn't move.
What the fuck possessed you?,You're the one who kept saying ram him.
How long has he been in there?,I don't know.
Not in that car you're not.,Watch me.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.,Don't threaten me, Bob.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.,Let's go.
Dignan.,Anthony. Bad news.
Come on in. What you been up to?,Not a whole lot, Bob.
Come on!,I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.,I didn't have any choice.
I'm sorry, Bob.,That's OK.
That's OK.,Look. We want you on the job.
Scarecrow?,Yeah?
What's wrong with Applejack?,He's having a heart attack or something.
Is he breathing?,I think so.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?,I didn't think there was an alarm.
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.,What's that?
Hold on --,Here we go.
How you doing, Bob?,Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
How long do you have to go?,26 weeks.
Ground defense.,Did you hear that?
Is he in?,I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
What do you mean grammar?,The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
He left his sweater.,Well, I left some money in there.
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.,Good to know you, John.
You told me Bourne was dead.,There was a mistake.
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.,And the Landy woman?
And what are we looking for?,I want to know about Treadstone.
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?,Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.,And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
Why not? It was just money.,And Danny Zorn, what was that?
She say what time I should call?,The sooner the better.
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.,And?
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...,Jesus...
Because you're afraid!,No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
So why didn't you kill me then?,She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
Who sent you to Greece?,A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
You drive.,What?
Switch! You drive!,-- where? -
I wanted to kill him.,But you found another choice.
See that tram coming around the corner?,Yes.
A Russian?,It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
And you got to him before we could.,I killed him???
That's a lie!,You never worked Berlin...
It's me.,Bourne?
What do you want?,I want to come in.
Okay, how do you want to do it?,I want someone I know to take me in.
Don't need it. I remember everything.,Sounds like a threat.
-- who? -- who else is here? --,-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
How long have you worked for the agency?,Me? Four years.
Good luck.,You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?,Am I a doctor, no, but...
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.,And why is that?
What do you think? Is he coming in?,I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
Do we know what this says?,Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.,By who?
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. ,Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
Yes. In that order.,And what about you, anything?
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.,My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
What are they doing?,Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
But... what will you do?,I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
Does anyone know his politics?,No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!,I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
Wallace has sacked York!,Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!,So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
No, M'lord.,Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
When will his trial be?,Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.,Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.,Fourteen? --
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.,We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
You know it's a trap.,Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
I don't want to be a martyr.,Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
They're English soldiers, ain't they?,With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.,Aye, we'll get 'em.
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.,The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?,I could crush you like a roach.
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.,A common thief.
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.,In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
Where is my son?,Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.,He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --,It matters not, he is thy king!
Thank you for accepting.,Thank you for inviting.
Then when?,...Tonight!
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.,How do you know this?
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?,...I wouldn't know.
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.,I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.,A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.,It does me good to see you.
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.,We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.,I must... consult with my father.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?,The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!,No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...,And the bad news?
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.,How soon?...
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.,Great. I'll see you soon.
I... I blacked out.,Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...,Sure...
I don't know. These things take time.,How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
There must be a way to fix this.,Fix?
You're. Acting. Like your father.,Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.,Can you protect me?
Just tell me if anything weird happens.,Weirder than this?
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.,You know my father?
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.,Where are my goddamn books?
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...,But I... I need those books.
You really think he wanted to kill you?,All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.,So let's go. This place creeps me out.
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.,Damn. Your dad did this?
I deserve a lot worse.,What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.,Hi, Lenny.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.,Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Not if you remember my dad.,Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?,So it didn't feel... weird?
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?,As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.,Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.,Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...,I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!,He's a fucking maniac!
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.,Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
Ha! Where's that?,The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.,Why's that?
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.,Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
Oh? There's proof now?,Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.,Who's to say you can't make things better?
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?,Deal. Now read me something.
Hey, what'd you do that for?,Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
Lung cancer?,Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
Here you go, buddy.,What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
I should have known.,My husband is with me, too.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?,No.
How long have you been married?,Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?,I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
Goodnight.,Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.,Well, I'll get it from the safe.
Here you are.,It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
What do you want for Sam?,I don't buy or sell human beings.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.,Suppose we do.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.,Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.,You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.,Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.,Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.,And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?,Yes, something.
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.,Good day.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.,And the other alternative?
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?,We said "no questions."
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?,All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.,No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?,Has it got a wow finish?
I don't know the finish yet.,Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?,You can believe that if you want to.
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.,All except one. He won't have you.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.,All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?,No, not yet.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?,Everything is quite all right.
I don't understand. What about you?,I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.,And I said I would never leave you.
Hello, Sam.,Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
Some of the old songs, Sam.,Yes, ma'am.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.,I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Goodnight.,Goodnight.
Goodnight.,Goodnight.
What happened with Rick?,We'll discuss it later.
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.,To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?,Apparently he has the letters.
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.,Sam?
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.,You're saying this only to make me go.
Your work.,Thank you. I try.
We'll come again.,Any time.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.,What of it?
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?,Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?,I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
Well, this might come in handy.,Thank you.
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?,We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.,You seem to know all about my destiny.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.,You love her that much?
But we made a deal.,Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
Yes.,But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
No, Captain, please.,No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.,Very well.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?,Thank you.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.,Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.,I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.,I see what you mean.
I was misinformed.,Huh!
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.,What, again?
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.,I stick my neck out for nobody.
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.,Our entertainment is enough.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.,Why two?
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.,Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Yeah, you were saying?,Excuse me.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.,Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.,Oh, thanks.
You're late.,I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.,Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
I have the letters right here.,Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Sam's piano.,Serves me right for not being musical.
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.,Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?,It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.,Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.,Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.,Hello Ugarte.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --,-- You thought what?
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?,They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.,For how long?
You ever going to bed?,No.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.,Good. Then have a drink.
Boss, let's get out of here.,No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.,She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?,You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
Can't.  Need water.,You've had today's water.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.,Do too much, I'll die.
No more water, you said.,Take it.
If they can't see you, what's the point?,Survive today, that's the point.
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...,Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.,Shut up.
You can't make it.,Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
To tell you the truth -- you did.,Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
Got to follow the paper path here.,Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
Four four.  A record.,You don't seem too happy about it.
I can't even keep fish alive.,A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
This isn't working out.,We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
No.,I can't take him to work.
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.,I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
Get back?  From where?,Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
Her name's Hannah.,Is that Jango?
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.,It means a lot...that you came.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.,And how was your Christmas?
Anything else?,There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?,Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
Which I didn't have.,And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
If you say you are.,I most definitely say I am.
Yes, yes he did.,You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Need some help?,You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?,That new roof, that's your doing.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.,There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
How'd it go?,Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.,But I might not have.
I was making a point.,What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
I didn't know we had sailboats.,It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.,We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
You are one sick fucker.,I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.,Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.
This stinks really bad.,You should have smelled me.
That's what it's about.,Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
What, then?,Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
May I ask, where are you bound?,San Francisco.  And you?
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!,"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
These *credentials* are against the law!,We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!,Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?,Dr. Homer Wells.
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.,I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!,I'm *not* a doctor!
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.,You cook very well!
And that I can drive a truck!,Better than I can!
What'd she die of?,She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
Shouldn't we tell Homer?,If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.,Good night, Daddy.
So, Mrs...,Candy. Candy Kendall.
Where's Mandalay?,Burma!
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.,It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?,When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
But you looked as if you liked it.,I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...,She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.,You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
You don't miss it?,I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
I *know* this was right.,Right.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.,Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?,We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.,Nothing.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?,No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.,*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
"...did." Well, okay.,Please don't...
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.,Yes, I *have*!
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying.",Well, they aren't.
I thought they might take me.,They wanted a girl.
That's a heavy sedation.,You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
*Liver* killed him?,*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
Did you know your mother better?,She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
Uh... it's the end of October.,Is that soon?
Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them.,Okay...
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...,What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.,This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.,You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.,When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
Christ, it's oil of tansy!,I don't know it.
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. ,Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
I am not a doctor.,You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?,Right.
Rose Rose?,Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
You're not yet three months, are you?,Not yet. What do you know about it?
Do you know him?,*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.,You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!,Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!,You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.,You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.,No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.,I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
Ten percent. Of how much?,Two million.
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.,Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
And I think it's because of this redhead...,Know who I am, Jake?
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.,Gee... What makes you say that?
Grifters...,We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
Nice.,We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
She had you tempting fate.,My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?,It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?,Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
So we go to the bar.,I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
Ten is standard, sir.,Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
Who's that?,The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.,So what? We hide, right?
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.,People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
Masters of our own destiny.,So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
Jake...,It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
Moonan. Here. Shit...,So what? We just stay clear of him.
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!,Jake, I mean, come on --
What? I can feel you looking at me.,That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
You know what we're doing with the money.,And what about Big Al?
You gotta be kidding me. Her?,Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.,No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --,Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
You'll be there?,Eight A.M. flight.
Calls?,We'll use the Euc.
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?,What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
I guess it lacks a certain style.,Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
You can't cheat an honest man.,You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
Why not?,Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.,No. Just confidence.
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --,Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
You told me to change my hair!,What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...,Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
Look at you... You want to go.,For what? A couple hundred bucks?
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.,It's what I do. It's my job.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?,Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Do you have something to prove?,Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
How do you know I will?,Intuition.
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.,Don't ruin this for me.
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.,Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.,Lily... Jesus Christ...
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.,Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
Sorry. I didn't know...,Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?,You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
You tell them the "Tale".,What do you want? An apology?
You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?,Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
Uh...,What?
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.,You going to have the time?
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.,Of what? They're both crooks.
What'd he say?,Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.
Can I speak to you in confidence?,Huh? Oh. She's alright.
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.,A little bit of both.
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.,A Fed? Is he close?
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --,Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?,Whaddya mean? We got dick.
It's just insurance.,That's what I'm talking about.
What are you doing?,High five.
Jack. Do you need a ride?,No. Thanks.
My car's in the garage.,Maybe another time.
I hate cheats.,All men are cheats.
I got scared.,I can imagine.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.,I despise the job.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?,A couple I know are getting married.
I get it.,Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
How's that football story corning along?,You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.,You want me drunk?
You really are a beautiful woman.,It's not just inner beauty, is it?
Where did you get it?,I. sold the car.
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.,How did you land that?
How did it go?,Fine.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.,I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.,Marion, stop this.
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.,He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?,Marion. It's a book.
Without hope there's no point to anything.,Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
What?,You were talking in your sleep.
Really?,Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.,Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Great.,Found a job?
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. ,All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
Yes, I know that.,Don't let yourself down.
I've lived there.,Well, thank you anyway.
To coincidence.,There's a casino in this hotel.
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.,The debts.
What happened?,Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.,Robbery's not criminal?
How much do you owe?,Let it go.
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.,Well, life's not fair. We know that.
It's all relative.  I need the money too.,Do you?
Yes.,The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
And your hand too.,I took the bandage off yesterday.
I don't think we should meet again.,It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
How are you?,Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Ross.,Who did it? Tell me!
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?,Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Does Bella come here?,That bitch? No.
Where did you go to school?,I was at Beadles.
There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.,Do you have a Salon Prive?
How many aces are left?,Five.
What makes you so sure?,It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.,What for?
Ever?,I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.,How?
Girlfriend?,Yes.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.,All right, Mr Reynolds.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.,Does he win?
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?,All right, then...
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?,He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
Rechannel all safety relays --,-- open quantum latches --
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?,Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?,Check at six minutes.
Armed.,Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Thanks.,Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?,Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.,Thanks.
The only thing which exists is myself.,Bomb?
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?,I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
This is fun.,All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?,To explode, of course.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.,True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?,Mafhkin oble groop...
In a second.,Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
What are you gonna name it?,What?
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.,I like it up here.
Doolittle! Help me.,Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?,Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
What happened, Doolittle?,Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.,I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.,No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Sir?,Phenomenology...
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.,I'm on a break.
What?,That's not why we're here.
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.,That's a lotta crap.
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.,But the boss knows I always been loyal.
Some of us are trying to sleep.,You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.,Leave.  Now.
Can I say something in my defense?,No.
How're ya doin', Max.,You mean until you showed up?
What are you doing here?,I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?,So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
What a creep.,And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
You didn't...,Every week.
I know.,I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
Sophy?  Are you okay?,Mommy, where are you?
Soon, baby.,Mommy, I'm scared.
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?,Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?,Too early to tell.
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?,People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
So what are you gonna do about it?,Something.
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.,You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?,I won't be staying.
You got a lotta nerve.,Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.,Bent?
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.,You need to get out more.
Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.,No, I meant this.
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?,Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
The other one like you...,You lost me.
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.,Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
I already don't like the sound of this.,The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.,So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
Well, not me personally.,On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
What's this?,Open it.
I need to talk to her.,Can't help you.
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.,Any idea when she'll be back?
None.,I'll wait.
Who are you?,My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.,How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.,You're also a fool.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...,Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
Say the words, "I understand.",I understand.
You drive away business roarin' in like that.,Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.,He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
Thank you.,He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.,How's this about me?
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.,You and me both.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.,What guys do.  'Nother order.
No.,He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
A fog bank.,More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
Friends don't help other friends cheat.,And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
Please...,They're prisoners to their genes.
So are dogs.,They don't have a lot of moving parts.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.,But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.,Pull the cash.
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?,You're the best, Maxie.
Probably a touch of what's going around.,I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
Catch you back at the wall.,Later.
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.,Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
You left out condescending.,But there's another side--
What happens if you level with her?,Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.,You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.,And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
True, but--,You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
Okay, okay, okay--,Say the words, "I understand."
That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--,Shut-up...
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...,He's sick.
For a change.,How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.,Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.,Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
Huh?,I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.,I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?,Hawk.
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?,Yeah, a man's drink...
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.,Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
No problem.,Thanks.
What are you, high?,Yeah.
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?,Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.,Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!,Check!
Whoa... she just farted.,I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Sunday, but...,Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
Now, how are we gonna do this?,Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.,Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.,Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
Cool, bro, now listen up...,...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Could be.,And if it ain't cleaned off?
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.,Oh, yeah...?
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?,Sure.
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?,The easy way.
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.,Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.,Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.,It's my Bullworker.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!,What's gone?
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.,Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.,Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
Mom, what're we...?,Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.,Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
Twenty-five more'n I got.,All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
Look, you can have my wallet...,It's not nearly enough, punk.
Two hundred bucks?,You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!,Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
Good morning, mongrels!,Good morning...
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!,GOOD MORNING!
Hi... what's going on here?,Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
What happened?,He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.,Could these wormholes appear in nature?
I'm not following you.,If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.,Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
When can I squeeze one out?,Not until like... eighth grade.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.,When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
Dea ex machina...,What did you say?
I want to show you something.,You have to do something for me first.
How much longer is this gonna last?,You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!,Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
Don't look so freaked.,I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.,That's easy. Antiseptics.
That was a compliment.,Will you go with me?
Where are we going?,No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?,No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.,With, like, images?
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...,And what?
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?,Who?
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?,She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?,What's wrong with you?
What?,There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.,The Lifeline is divided that way.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.,Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.,Do you get to meet Ed?
Know what?,Where it came from?
You're my only son...,I know, Dad.
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.,Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
What's "Cellar Door"?,A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
His name is Frank.,Frank.
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?,Yes.
Can anyone else see him?,I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?,I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
A sign from whom?,I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?,No. That makes you keep searching.
People get hurt.,But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.,But you were punished.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.,What did you want for Christmas that year?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.,How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Because I'm so horny.,God exists because you're horny.
What is going to happen?,Frank is going to kill.
What's her name?,You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.,Her name is Gretchen.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.,Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Gerald.,Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?,Frank?
Our son just called me a bitch.,You're not a bitch.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.,You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.,Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...,Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
Chut up!,Go back to China, bitch!
There's no rule!,Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
Where is she?!,She's right over there.
So, what do I say?,Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
Oh my God. I'm so dead...,Yeah, you betcha...
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.,Loretta, never have kids.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.,Really?
Amber? Here.,"Here," wh-wh-what?
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.,Yah?
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.,Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.,Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys.",No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.,Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
Go on! Get out!,Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.,What?!
Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.,You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.,Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
Bye mom.,We was robbed.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?,Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.,Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.,Bitch!
Are we on "Cops" again?,You could be quiet.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?,Loretta, shut it.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...,"Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.,All right, they're makin' a movie.
Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!  If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!,Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.,It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.,My dress'll reek.
I'm a mirror.,Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
Wisconsin.,All right, then.
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.,This pageant's like a roach motel.
Girls check in, but they don't check out.,Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?,Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!,Gladys! Stop it!
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.,That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!,Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.,What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!,He should be king!
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?,"My dear"...
Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts.,I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?,About - thirty-four seconds.
In her dressing room?  Why, what could he be doing there?,He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.
What kind of a dog is he?,He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
Well - what is he now?,He's half poodle and half watch dog -
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?,I don't want him.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.,Did you shoot the rapids?
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.,Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.,Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?,Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
Then I demand an apology!,That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?,She did.
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?,I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
You no gotta no gun.,Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... ,I can't do it...
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.,That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
So! -- He's on your side, too.,Sure.
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.,All right -- I'll go out and find one.
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!,So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.,Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
That's what you think.,You swine!
Give me that again!,You worm!
Once more! ,You upstart!
Then it's war?,Yes.
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!,I still like UPSTART the best.
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.,That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.,I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
Oh, won't you reconsider...,Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...,Now -- er --
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?,Why -- why -- of course.
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!,I didn't come here to be insulted.
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.,That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...,Perhaps he will listen to you...
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.,She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.,If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?,No, I think a whiskey.
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.,Well, these things take time.
More romances for John?,Hmmm?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?,...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
I found it.,Did you see it?
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!,He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
Don't!,Shut up!
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!,You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!,All you do is profit from another man's misery!
Now I think we really do understand one another.,Right... Right.
You've acquired a taste for this?,It's quite nutritious, sir.
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?,Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Oh, is he a friend of yours?,No, more of an acquaintance.
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?,Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.,Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.,Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.,Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.,I could easily arrange...
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?,Well, yes.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.,Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.,Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?,You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.,Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?,You've never been?
Tell me about it, please!,It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
Have you read it?,No, but I certainly shall.
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.,I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
Is he... dying then?,Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
You alright?,y-y-yes--
Want to come out?,You're English.
Of course! You want out?,Yes.
Thank you very much.,Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.,Yes.
Yes.,Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Hello...,My name is...
John... Merrick,Say "Merrick".
John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.,Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
The hospital?,Of course! What did you think?
How long will I stay here?,I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?,I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?,Oh yes.
Who are they of?,Oh, our relatives... the children.
No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.,I thought as much.
The cathedral is coming along nicely.,Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
Stand up, John. Let them see you.,Oh no, I couldn't.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?,Yes, very soon.
No, John, not one that I can see.,Then I shouldn't change anything?
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?,Fine.
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.,Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
A dressing bag?,You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?,I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?,YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
Well... where is he?,There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....,I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...,She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
It's all right! It isn't happening!,But, Father, it IS!
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!,Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
WHAT did you say?,I said welcome.
Those things in your hands.,These? What are THESE? They're swords.
What's the matter?,PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?,What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
What was she like?,Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...,Five this week; how many the week before?
But you don't realize....,Goodbye, Aud...
But --,It was my master Keitel's idea.
What do you see, Erik?,I see the world.
How?,Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Would you like us to sing to you?,That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?,Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
But you don't want to hear it.,No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.,You're just saying that.
You don't know Halfdan the Black.,I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
Is there something the matter with it?,Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
What about the raping?,Shut up.
No. It isn't rape then, is it?,Oh, get it over with.
I don't suppose... no...,What?
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.,About raping me?
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.,I didn't mean to!
Why?,What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
Why should you care?,I don't know! I just did!
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?,Find it... AND cross it!
What's wrong with making friends?,You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
That's terrible!,You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
It's always the women that start the trouble.,She got me thinking...
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!,Sorry.
Faster!,Make your mind up.
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.,Why should WE care?
It's SO nice to feel wanted.,Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!,Well, come on!
A magic dishcloth.,To the oars!
No! Let go, Snorri!,I've got you!
There is another way.,Who gets killed?
Wait, Erik!,Keitel Blacksmith?
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.,But...
Well, what else do we do?,How about making friends?
ROW!,DEATH!
Hy-Brasil?,Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...,Over the Edge of the World.
It can't do you any HARM...,What do we have to do?
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?,That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!,Mum! Dad!
I'm not worth risking your life for.,I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
Can't make enough axe-heads!,But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
Together we stand!,You can't let Erik do THAT.
Sh! Hurry!,YOU do it!
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.,I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
I must KILL! Kill!,It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
There is nothing we can do...,Helpless...
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.,I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
May I help you?,Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
Ms. Kruczynski?,Hi.
You rat.,I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
I'm so excited. Yay!,I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
What's wrong with me?,Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
Why what?,Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.,Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
I don't really know how --,Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
My name's Clementine, by the way.,I'm Joel.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.,I don't know any jokes about your name.
Huckleberry Hound?,I don't know what that means.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?,Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.,See, I wouldn't think that about you.
You're sure? It's cold.,I don't want to take you out of your way.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.,You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
So you like bookstores, huh?,I like to read.
Frost?,Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.,I'm fine.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.,Thanks.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.,That's scary sounding.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?,I think so.
Tomorrow?,Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?,You didn't say anything about my hair.
Yo ho ho!,It's three.
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.,...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.,Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
I don't think we're ready.,You're not ready.
What?!,I don't want to talk about this here.
Such a beautiful view.,Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
What if you hide me?,What do you mean?
You remember what happened next?,I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.,Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
Joel!,I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.,This is our first "date" date.
Do you remember what we talked about?,Naomi, I guess.
Right. Something black though.,I'll buy that. Black's always good.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:,So what. Infatuation is good, too.
It's very late.,Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?,And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.,I know.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.,I don't think I've slept in a year.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.,yeah?
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.,Okay.
Me too. There's this poem --,Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
I think, before.,Seems too coincidental that way.
I do sort of live with somebody though.,Oh.
Male or female?,Female.
Cool.,What are you doing?
What if you stay this time?,I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.,That's okay. I --
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.,I'm nervous, too.
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.,Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.,I don't know.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.,I guess so.
Yeah?,Did you send this? Is it a joke?
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.,Hi.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.,I'm like a joke to them.
Clementine.,That's your look for me.
So then she just stops calling.,I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...,And what are you like? A wino?
How's the chicken?,Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.,I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.,Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.,Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
Don't say "we" when you mean "you.",I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.,No. I just need some space, maybe.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?,It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.,We'll speak soon.
Oh, hey, Patrick.,Hi, Mary. How's it going?
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?,Yeah. Cool.
Definitely!,I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
Boo.,Hi.
It's freezing out.,You found us okay?
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.,Where?
What do you want, Stan?,Can I... I brought some --
I know what it is.,Then why did you ask me?
Thanks.,Welcome, Howard.
Okay, we're back in.,That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
What, Howard?,We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?,I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!,I have a family, Mary.
Well, where was Patrick?,He went home sick.
Mary. What are you doing here?,She came to help, Howard.
So, I've got to drop the van off.,Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.,Yeah.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.,You can if you want.
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.,Patrick, we need to focus.
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.,She was unconscious, Patrick.
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.,Siwash, huh?
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.,The Clock People?
Is everything getting worse?,Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.,Easy come, easy go.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?,I'm staying with the Countess.
You're political, then?,No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.,Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.,You don't agree with Debbie, then?
What do you think?,Well.... er...
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.,If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.,What guy?
Thanks.,American Cheese. The king of road food.
You're the best?,When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?,Tired...
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.,I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
Ballast.,I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
...do you copy?,Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --,You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!,EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
We have a man down...,Coop, where are you...
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.,You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...,Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...,No, he didn't.
Can you shut it down?,I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
How is he?,His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.,"Another man?" Who?
You wanted to see me, Admiral?,I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.,Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.,That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
What does?,The dark inside me.
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.,How do you know all this?
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.,We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...,That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.,Yes, sir!
Justin, finish your sweep.,Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Patch me through to him.,Justin.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...,Justin. I won't let you die.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.,I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
What's the hold up?,Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
We've got pressure.,Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
Jesus its huge.,Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...,There's no one here, Skipper.
Can anybody hear me...,Skipper...
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.,I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
Captain Miller, I just want to say...,The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.,Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
I can see that, what're they for?,In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.,Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
Yes.,One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
If it worked.,If it worked, yes.
Explanation?,Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!,What do you want me to say?
You said this ship creates a gateway...,Yes...
We're leaving.,You can't, your orders are specific...
Jesus...,What is that?
We've got some weather.,I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.,No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
Sir.,Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
Now what?,She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.,We can take the filters from the Clark...
Who?,Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...,"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
You've got to listen...,To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
I'll do it --,No. I'll be right back.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?,You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Almost got it.,Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
We have to do something, oh God...,Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... ,Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
If they are, they're screening their calls.,Range 3000 meters and closing.
What happened to his eyes?,Explosive decompression.
What is it?,I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.,Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
What are you doing?,It wants me. I have to go.
I don't think She's real big on hate.,You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.,Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --,It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
What are you doing here?,I'm worried about you.
What do you want, Vic?,To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
I can't take this.,Ben. This is business. Just work.
What about his first born?,Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
Can't do it. I cannot do it.,External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.,I'm sure he's matured since then.
How long was I out?,Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.,Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Are you alright?,I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --,Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.,'Course not. Strictly business.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.,Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --,Give me the god damn mirror!
No more cracks about how I look.,Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --,And they're changing into...
And where do we think we're going?,I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
I mean, you feel a little feverish.,I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
I though we went over this.,Last one down springs for room service.
You're on fire!,Not this again --
Now what is up with that?,The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.,Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --,Johnny.
Stop it.,Okay, "mom."
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!,You gave us names? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
They're ready for you, sir.,Showtime.
How's the IPO?,Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.,Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
I, uh, think I remember the number.,It's been changed.
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.,Great minds think alike.
That's good. That's uh... good.,You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
You're happy for me and Victor.,I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.,Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --,What in the world would give me that idea?
There were a lot of variables to consider --,No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.,You were?
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.,I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
I can... make it work.,Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?,Hilarious.
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.,Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Come on, Ben, come on...,Reed, we're running out of time.
Not until Ben is back inside!,It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?,Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --,Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Victor, your scar --,I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --,Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --,Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --,I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
I can't find it, mon!,It's the first door on your left!
On the ledge?,First door on your left!
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.,I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.,I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.,Manager!!
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?,Where did you hear that?
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.,Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
Are you still a virgin?,Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.,See you later.
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?,Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?,He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.,O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
Are you really a virgin?,Come on...
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.,He's my friend, too.
You're a really good kisser.,So are you.  Are you shaking?
Oh. Hi.,I didn't see you this morning.
Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.,You should work for yourself.
I would. Yeah.,Really?
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.,I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
Hey, Rat.,Yeah?
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.,What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?,All right. Pay attention.
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.,I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
Mark. What happened to your date?,It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
Hey, Mark. Is that you?,Damone! You come here?
Poor guy.,Really.
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?,No Damone. I don't understand.
You're losing it, Damone.,You're crazy. Those girls love me.
Are you Linda Barrett?,Yes.
Not if you're over sixteen.,Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
Seen the new Playboy?,Naw. Any good?
Suzanne Somers' tits.,All right.
We just missed the turnoff to the party.,You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.,Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.,What should I do?
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?,Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.,I know.
Do you think guys find that attractive?,Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?,Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.,You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
How long does Doug take?,I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
It couldn't be.,It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
Not coming? What happened?,He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Mr... Mr. Hand.,That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
What's that?,Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.,All right! Oh, yeah!
You look like you could still be in high school.,I know, everyone says that.
How about the point?,The point sounds fine.
Are you really nineteen?,Yes... I am really nineteen.
I think I better take you home.,What about those other guys you live with?
Do you have Mrs. George for English?,Yeah. She is pretty good.
Do you know what you want?,I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Are you all right?,Oh yeah.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?,Not at all.
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.,Do you want to come inside?
...I've got to go home.,Do you really have to go?
What's April 16th?,It's John Bonham's birthday.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?,Awake? What do you mean?
There's no hurry! The race is over!,Not for me.
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?,Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?,Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Rum and ice, please.,You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
What happened? What did they do to her?,Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
Where ya comin' from, young man?,Las Vegas.
O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring.  What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?,Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.,We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
Where's the medicine?,The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!,Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?,Lacerda?
Shoot it.,Not yet. I want to study its habits.
That's good...,I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
Why?,Why what?
I have to go.,GO?
When does this thing stop?,It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.,Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.,No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.,Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
What tape?,Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!,BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
You cheap honky sonofabitch...,Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
Lucy.,Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
NO! Stop talking like that.,I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.,In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.,That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
What is this?,You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.,Some of what?
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.,Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
What made you do it? Who paid you off?,Nobody. I'm the maid!
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?,I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
You'd pay me for that?,You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing.",I fear nothing.
May I see your license.,Of course, officer.
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?,How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
What?,One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?,Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
We should go! We should go right now!,He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
We'll meet in three hours?,I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?,Nah, I got the gun.
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?,Her fella.
Well, it don't look pretty.,But it's got teeth.
I don't think you should...,With what just happened upstairs --
One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.,Gonna stay for a couple?
Oh!,"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
Wha?,OPEN THE DOOR!
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --,There's a tunnel.
You all sure about this?,Follow me.
We just smeared a skunk.,Shit!
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.,Just move!
You seem mighty collected about this.,Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
Scared?,No. You?
So, what now? Did those things leave?,Why don't you go check it out?
Come on!,He's dead.
All right!  Tell us about the truck!,Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
How are you holding up?,Well...
What is this?,Magic potion.  You should try a little.
How much you got to see the show?,You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
He's dead.,What?
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?,He only shot you once.
Four door?,Two.
Max?,Seven.
NO, but I will lock you in.,What?
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.,Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
What?!,Move slow and move quiet.
Move it!,You keep that key handy.
SHIT.,MOVE YOUR ASS!
COME ON!,HELLLLLLLLP!!
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.,You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
OH JESUS!,HELLLPPP!
Hey!,Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?,Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?,Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
Let's wait it out.,They'll tear this place down within the hour.
If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.,Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.,Let's lock off this room.
You know you don't have to do this.,I'm fine, I really am.
Her name is Charlie.,Oh...
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.,Deal.
We should stick together out there.,I'd love to.
Did we make it?,I think --
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?,Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
Well... come on.,This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?,You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.,'Forgive'...? For What?
I guess so, sir.,Very fine bone structure.
Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?,But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
No, I'm concerned with everything.,But I'm the one up there on the screen.
Hi Frances, got a minute?,Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
You know what I mean.,Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!,I'm not!
You're afraid!,I'm not!
Madam...?,Thank you.
The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --,Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
What's up?,I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.,Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?,Dick, we need some time apart --
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!,Dick...
Harry!,I gotta go now.
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?,Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.,We'll get you home, Frances.
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!,Thank you.
Thank you, Ralph.,Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.,Is Kaminski a Communist?
What do I do, Dad?,You really want to go?
You're poisoning that child's mind.,I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
I'm going back to the hotel.,Good.
But, Kurt, I...,No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
Name?,I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
Why... yes.,Then don't go to Hollywood.
Okay then...,Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!,Yeah, well --
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.,Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
Harry.,Harry.
Well? What'd you think?,I just wanted to see how you looked.
What?,Quietly.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.,I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Frances...,What?
Jesus.,Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.,Forget it.
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.,But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... 
How the hell do you find me anyway?,Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
What a man!,Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.,Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?,Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
Frances! Frances!,Who?
Where to?,Oh Harry...
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.,Yeah. I don't know.
Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.,Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
Oh, you...  ...ennh.,Well... you're looking well.
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?,I'm not sure.
Yeah.,What'd you do?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?,I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Did you expect him to look you up?,Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?,'Golden Boy.'
How's it sound?,The speech? Real good.
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --,Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.,Mama, what's...
It's your fan mail, little sister.,You kill me, Mama.
At one. Promise?,Sure.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.,Yes, Mama.
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?,I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?",I'll have someone show you to your room.
...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?,Yes. It was very good to see her.
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.,Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
Come warm yourself if you like.,You speak.
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?,There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
What is this?,A brain. Extremities.
She's beautiful.,She's not for you.
Poor William! What indignant tears!,There, there... shhh...
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.,Quite right!
You dance so beautifully together.,And you look so lovely.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.,So have I
I should go. I should leave today.,Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
Are you all right?,Fine.
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.,It's far too late for him to still be out.
Don't cry, Elizabeth.,Aren't you?
Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!,Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
Smell the air. Wonderful.,Quite a send-off, isn't it?
You will.  What do you want, Victor?,To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
I thought I'd never see you again!,I'm all right. I'm safe,
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.,Aye, Captain.
Professor?,Oh God.
Rich old ladies and their daughters?,Can you think of a better reason?
Only you would think of that!,Somebody has to!
They just caught the man who did it.,He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
You're making a scene!,Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!,No. He had more important work.
This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?,Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
Yes? And?,Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Are you sure you'll be all right?,Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.,Let it go.
I have always loved him.,Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
Paracelsus?,Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
What is your name?,Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.,Despite the lack of challenge.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.,You disdain accepted wisdom?
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.,The strain was evident.
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.,Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
Creature? A... human like creature?,You know of it?
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.,No, no, they're all dead...
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?,Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?,You told her to sweep the courts.
Next Friday.,Thanks, Alice.
How come you're leaving?,It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
You can only do what you can do.,And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
I don't hear it anymore.,Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
What's the matter with it?,Wet. I don't know.
I wouldn't know.,Oh, you...
You saved my life.,I had to.
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.,A short somewhere.
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?,I don't believe you...
Holy shit...,We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
Don't call him.,I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
Mmmmmmmph?,Mmmmmmmph.
You okay?,Those things can be nasty.
I mean...,...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.,You've made a science out of coincidence.
How many with you?,Just my son and I.
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?,You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
Yeah, follow us.,So let's do it.
What are you gonna do?,I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.,Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.,He's running the show.
Why did they block the door again?,To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
Not a chance.,Come again?
Is this real?,Yes.
You're a preacher?,I was a minister.
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.,Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!,You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --,That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
What do you think Mom would say?,Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...,Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
I'm going for 'em!,No!
What?,In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
What did I say?,You asked me if I would --
Creepy guy.,The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
Do you believe me?,Yes.
Watch my back!,Anytime.
See ya.,Later.
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --,-- you got your microwave --
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?,You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.,Knock yourself out.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.,I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
What the fuck was that about?,He signaled the Ranger.
What the fuck is wrong with you --,Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
Yeah?,When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
Did you even to try to negotiate?,These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
All I'm saying --,-- This conversation is over.
What'd ya see?,Cops.
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?,She's in the other room.
They're gonna search the van.,As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.,Really?
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!,Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.,It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
That's what you think?,That's how you're lookin', Richie.
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.,Yeah, it's mine.
I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man.",I've been accused of that wish.
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --,Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
Of course, but there's more --,Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.,Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?,No, sir.
No, sir, WHAT?,The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
See me, sir?,You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
I'm saying, we're just friends.,I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...,I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
Aw, what is this...,Sir...
Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!,Fuck me.
"The Lark Report.",Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
"Coronado.",California.
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?,This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Uh, ma'am.,Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --,Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?,Absolutely not.
So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?,What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?,I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
You'll think about my offer?,You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?,I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?,I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
Time.,Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.,Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.,Get it up!
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?,What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
That was good headwork, lieutenant.,Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?,Is this my glory, sir?
So why are you telling me this?,Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?,Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?,I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.,I don't know, I don't care.
So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.,Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?,Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.,That's a good story.
Last time I didn't.,Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me...
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.,Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
32 feet, six inches!,I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --,Educate her, Pyro.
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.,Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?,Your new roommate.
Anybody usin' these drawers here?,Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
You don't suppose this is just part of...,FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
Thought you two were file-closed.,You knew about us?
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?,Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...,Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?,Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
You okay?,It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.,Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
My God. He's going after the nest.,Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
Animal, I can't.,Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.,You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.,Yeah, well...
And you think this creature is one of them?,Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.,I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
What are you doing here?,I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
Circuits are overloaded.,I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.,Speak of the devil.
My life sucks.,Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
Did Romeo have a name?,Nick Tatopoulos.
Mr. Caiman, you're married.,And you're beautiful...
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.,So have dinner with me tonight.
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...,Not now. You got my bag?
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.,Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...,Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Really? A girlfriend then?,No. Perhaps I work too much.
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.,Have them sealed off.
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.,They are with me!
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.,We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.,What are you suggesting?
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.,Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?,Sure.
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.,Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.,Well good, that's very... nice.
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?,Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.,I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
Come on, old friend...,Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
You WILL go out there.,I won't and nothing you say-
At ease men.,Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!,... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!,Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?,Yes. Good was done this .....
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...,No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
Settle down, Alex...,No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
He wants to THINK!?,No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
And note the sucked in gut.,...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...,Dear God.... How did I come to this?
Alex you can't -just leave.,Oh can't I? Watch me!
A boy comes to the door.,I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
"Go into the cloud! ...,Alex? Where are you going?
I don't know.,Nobody was WATCHING?
You said "the Commander.,What?
Yes but, we were wondering-,There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.,What's  your name, son?
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...,It's okay. Listen-
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.,We'd never have the budget for this.
But you don't?,No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
No, wait, are you-,Lt. Madison, GO.
Go. They're off again.,Up.
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?,Yes?
What's the weather like outside?,There is no weather in space.
The ship is sustaining structural damage.,Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?,The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.,We need another one.
Systems register functional.,All systems are working, Commander.
The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?,Right.
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.,You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
As good as Hopkins?,Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
It's suicide.,I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?,We're doing episode 31, Jason?
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?,Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
It's... I don't know.,No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!,BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?,No. Keep all energy to the armor.
You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?,Not a clue. You?
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.,How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?,Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!,It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.,Jason..
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.,I don't think that's a cloud...
Can it be repaired?,Computer, can it be repaired?
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.,Why does this sound so familiar?
Clenched jaw...,Will you stop RIDING ME?!
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?,Right.
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.',Gwen...
That's it, It's go time.,Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
You should have let me hit him.,I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
I heard it too.,Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
Tommy, look!  Those lights...,I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-,Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?,Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...,You have ten seconds.
But what if Sarris survives?,Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
Former Commander?,I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
Mathesar? What is that?,It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.,You what?.. What are you talking about?
"Deception..." "Lies.",Well... Sort of...
A model, only as big as this.,But... Inside, I have seen-
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.,But...Why?
You said we do appearances together, or not at all.',I didn't say that.  I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.
Where?,Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
Could be this.,Push It. Hold it down.
Oh, right, sorry.,Okay, let's go.
enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are,Get oacK on their tail.
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.,What does she see in them?
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?,Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
Over three hundred miles.,You seem pleased by the prospect.
Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.,Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.,Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
Have you heard?  The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.,I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  It's becoming the American way!,You go too far, Benedict.
Well, what have you thought?,Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?,Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?,The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!,Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
I'm so inclined.,Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College.,To learn to shoot cannon?
Are you going to keep him, sir?,We better, Congress invented him.
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.,I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?,Yes, I believe so.
That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?,You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  Not a dictator over subjects?
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.,George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.,As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!,Lafayette is a child!
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...,Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
Partially...,It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?,These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
The British army, sir!,The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.
Unofficially, General Greene.,What's the difference?
Colonel Reed...,George!  So good to be back!
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!,They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!,Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...,Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.,And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
That's right...,And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.,You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...,They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country.,You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire.  I don't need to be in government.
George, you know I only love you, but...,But not more than your comfort.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.,Really?  Which precious homily was it?
Where... do those men come from, George?,Africa, of course.
Then why are you teaching me...?,Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.,The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
The land here is best for grain and corn.,Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season.
What is this?,An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.,Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.,Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.,They all sound big at the talking stage.
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.,I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
Trade for what?,The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.,I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
About sixty.,No shit? What're some of 'em?
You gave him the money?,I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?,Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?,You can talk to me.
Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.,It's what he said, I'm his associate.
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.,Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
You know Laurel Canyon?,I'll find it.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.,You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?,Leo, I don't know.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?,Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
The airport.,It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.
I don't know.,It's not the kind of thing you do.
C-18.,That's the magic number.
Ray Barboni?,Who is this?
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?,Ray. Look at me.
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?,Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
Sovereign.,You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
You live in Miami?,That's right.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?,I'm in the movie business.
Your wife a Lakers fan?,I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
Something shouldn't be there.,Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
That's the idea. I'll think about it.,That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?,We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
Come on, Harry - Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.,Fuckin' basketball game.
So he comes to L.A...,I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
She looks familiar.,She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.,He drown?
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.,So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
Really.,Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?,Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.,What Get Away jet?
It was in the Herald.,Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.,'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
We talk different?,It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
How about this?,That's not bad.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.,Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.,Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.,Buddy?
What's that?,Compass.
Whatta you think, Chill?,That's not bad. I think you got it down.
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.,I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?,They report it to the IRS.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?,Who told you that?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.,How'd you know I was here?
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?,At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
It's not one of these?,You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
The door from the patio, in back.,You broke in?
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.,I know what a vig is.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?,What're you doing here?
Rough day on the set?,I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons -
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.,He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.,Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?,Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
Were you scared up there?,You bet.
I told you not to -,Don't say a fuckin' word.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.,You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
Whatta you doing out there?,I'm going into the movie business.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.,I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?,Come on in.
What's wrong?,Be quiet and listen.
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.,Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
I don't have a dog.,You don't? What happened to Muff?
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.,Oh, yeah, sure.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?,He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
Which two?,Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.,Shylock?
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?,A passenger liner. Over.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.,Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.,I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?,They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
How about now?,Sixty pounds.
What? You sure?,That's what it says.
Damn mind of it's own.,Morning, skipper.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.,We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
Let's not be too hasty.,Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
One more?,Why not.
You think that's funny,No.
Ready?,Bring it on, dude.
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.,Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
Guess I'll just keep working.,What're you crazy?
Light in those passages ain't so good.,I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?,Seen a lota movies.
Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside.,Then what the hell happened to him?
Mother fucker!,What is it?
What's this?,Turbine rotor's shot.
I thought you said it was just a blade.,Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
How long?,Three, four days.
Went aboard.,She take a radio?
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.,It looks like it.
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.,The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.,Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?,We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
On a passenger ship in 1953?,If they knew what they were carrying.
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.,I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.,What do you propose?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!,I don't know what you're talking about?
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!,You smashed it!
What the fuck -- ?,You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.,Right.
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.,There's a charming thought.
I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.,Better than starving to death.
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.,I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
Go on.,Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
Coffee?,Yeah. Thanks.
She was sailing up north, right?,Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.,Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
What guy?,There's somebody else on this boat.
The same day she supposedly went down.,Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.,But where's the damage?
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.,Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
It's not gonna hold us.,Doesn't matter.
Hey.,Hey.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?,I don't know, are we?
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.,Not our mystery guest again.
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.,Showing you what?
Murphy to Epps.,Epps, over.
So you killed them?,The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.,Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
Yeah.,There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
Call the Coastguard?,Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
Morning.,You're up late.
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.,It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
I say we off-load some of that gold now.,Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
Ho-ly shit.,Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.,And look what happened.
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.,Shut up.
We're still drifting.,The mooring hasn't come taught.
Can't find the shotgun.,So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.,You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
Have you seen my blue spatula?,Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.,Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Maxine.,Not the Maxine?
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.,I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
About what?,Yeah, I heard about that.
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.,She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...,Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...,Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Did you actually do this painting?,Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?,Uh-oh.
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?,I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
...wow...,So what do you think?
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...,But I was only trying to be friendly...
It's not optional!,Jesus...
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.,Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!,That's just the way I am!
God, what a bunch of retards...,I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!,What?
This is so bad, it's almost good.,This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
Shut up!,Uh oh... don't turn around...
Hi.,Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!,We should follow them!
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.,God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
What is this?,I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
I want to "make love" to him.,I'm going to tell him you said that.
SHUT UP!,She says she wants to MMPH!
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.,I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
That was truly pathetic.,I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...,It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
Not really...,Forget it, I can't explain it...
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.,Somewhere downtown.
I'll bet he never jerks off...,Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Why are we going here? I hate this place.,It'll only take a second.
How about this one?,Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
Give me all your money, bitch!,Where did you get that?
But those are our people...,Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.,Like what?
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.,I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
He gives me a total boner!,He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?,Wasn't it like eighth grade?
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.,Fuck it. Everything must go!
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?,Yeah, I guess... call me...
Hello?,Do you still want to do something tonight?
What happened to Seymour?,I can't believe it - he actually scored!
Please let me come with you. Please please please...,I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
I dunno...,Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?,Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!,Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?,What are you doing here, Melorra?
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.,Well, we won't keep you.
May I ask what you're doing?,Shhh!
Do you have any other old records besides these?,Seymour does.
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.,Where did you get those pants?
Fine, and how are you?,Did you bring that tape?
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.,Well why do I care about that?
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.,I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
Yeah, sure, I guess...,Watch my stuff.
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?,Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!,I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?,I really didn't get a good look at her.
I don't think so...,PLEASE? We have to!
I really don't think it's a good idea.,Fine, I'll go by myself then...
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?,Jesus, Seymour.
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?,What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
What, are you a klansman or something?,Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...,Yeah, but still...
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?,No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?,Who knows?
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!,How can you be so sure?
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...,What? You're kidding me...
Boo!,YAAA!
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...,Really?
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?,Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...,So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --,What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
No, of course not.,So, do you like me, Seymour?
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...,I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
...What do you mean?,Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
What's up?,Can you at least let me in?
Uh... sure... come in.,Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
What's the matter?,Do you have anything to drink?
Uh... I think there's some root beer...,What about this?
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.,I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!,That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.,Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?,I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!,I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!,Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?,He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?,She's not at home?
Seymour?,Yes?
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.,He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?,My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
You've never built in Africa.,But I have in India- every country presents problems.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.,I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-,-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.,Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?,I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
What?,I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-,-please- you needn't be so graphic-
That's a terrible idea-,-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.,We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.,What if there are complications?-
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?,Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.,Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.,Have you got that in writing? 
Finish your tour?,And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
I don't suppose I could watch.,Might be exciting for you.
...one shot...,So that's what a lion looks like. 
Samuel says you killed a lion.,It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
Goddammit!,It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there.
Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?,Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this-  -they're doing it for pleasure.
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?,Don't they have to be?...
They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.,Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
I'll have to.,I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
Why do the workers look unhappy?,Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 
The workers don't get on?,Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them. 
Did it look like this in your mind?,This is more difficult-
Do you love her?,I do, actually; very much.
Soon. ,I have to ask- why do you need me?
Thank you.  Why does he need you by him?,He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times...  ...he knows I am afraid of lions...
How many cattle?,Four should do it.
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?,Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.,We don't have a relationship.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.,I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?,Certainly.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.,I won't.
Hello, Peter.,You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.,I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
What do you think?,There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?,Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.,It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?,I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?,I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?,For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Can I help you?,Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.,Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?,Oh, sure, that sounds great.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?,Okay.
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.,How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?,Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.,Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.,Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
You've got to do something!,Who are they?
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.,Maybe they just want to appeal.
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.,Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.,I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.,I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.,You were the one who got me in.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?,Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
Who was that?,Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.,You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
Nothing.  Not a trace.,Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
Six feet -- seven -- eight --,That's it.  It's on the bottom.
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.,Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --,Something good --
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.,You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.,There's something very familiar about this painting.
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.,Oh, hiya, Pete.
So, no goat hooves, huh?,I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Who, Ray?,Dana!  Dana Barrett!
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.,It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
And now you're going to eat it?,No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
This is what you do with your spare time?,This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
Like a goat on garbage.,We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
What kind of tests?,Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
Did you find anything at Dana's?,Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.,I'll get one more reading.
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.,Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.,Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.,Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.
She's moving!,I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.,Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
Now where are you going?,To the bathroom, where do you think?
Ready?  What is it?,Ummm -- figure eight?
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...,Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.,So what do you think it was?
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.,Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
You really don't act like a scientist.,No?  What do I act like?
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.,This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.,All right.  What do you want to do?
I want to help you.,I'll scream.
Don't scream.,Then leave.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.,All right.
Okay.  Then I'll go.,Goodbye.
Can't you tell me now?,I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
What's he doing in my refrigerator.,I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
He is the Destructor.,Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.,Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.,Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.,One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
What's that got to do with it?,Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.,Thank you.
Great!  How's it going?,Are you Peter Venkman?
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?,In a storage facility.
May I please see the storage facility?,Why do you want to see it?
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.,I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
Did you see anything?,Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
All right.  I'll try.,I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
He wants to shut down the storage grid.,If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
Sorry, Buddy!,We'd better adjust our streams.
It's working!,Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.,And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?,Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
I told you it's real.,What do we do now?
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.,You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.,Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
For what purpose?,To go into business for ourselves.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.,But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?,Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.,Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.,So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Third floor.  Get down here,,Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
How do you know?,I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
I should at least have you, don't you think?,If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
Those are priceless sculptures.,I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.,If I may be so bold...
Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.,You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
Caesar, ignore them.,Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.,I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
Yes, Caesar?,Jerses -- tomorrow...
Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.,Yes, Caesar.
You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...,This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.,Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.,The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.,That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
The Senate too?,The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.,You don't know how wrong you are.
Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?,They can't... if this is Rome...
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?,I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.,Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.,Tomorrow?
As soon as I can.,On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.,What deal?
You brought the army into Rome.,I was summoned.
He's very realistic.,Isn't the helmet magnificent?
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!,If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?,General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.,Alive... I'm alive...
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?,On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...,I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.,I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.,I want nothing to do with the arena.
Aren't you eating?,No.
Why not?,If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
I think I'd better go home now please.,But, Elaine --
I want to go home.,But could I just tell you this one thing?
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.,No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.,No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
Where we going?,I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Did they ever find out?,No.
Yes.,Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
What?,That woman. The older woman.
Yes.,Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?,Because -- I am.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.,What did she say?
Can I just sit here while you're packing?,If you want.
What are you looking for?,My belt.
The marble?,The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
Are you going home?,No.
Benjamin?,What?
You won't?,I don't know.
But you might.,I might.
I just don't think it would work.,Why wouldn't it?
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --,Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
Ben!,Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Exactly how do you mean?,There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.,Ahhh.
You're not one of those agitators?,What?
Mr. McCleery?,You heard me. Out of here.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?,I am going to call the police now.
Will you bring up my purse before you go?,I have to go now. I'm sorry.
Mrs. Robinson?,I'm in the bathroom.
Where are you?,-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.,It's in the main ballroom.
What do you drink? Bourbon?,Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?,I'm very neurotic.
What do you think of me?,What do you mean?
Oh my God.,Pardon?
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?,It's all right.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.,All right. Now finish your drink.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --,No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?,Yes, I have --
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?,What if he did?
But they would! Don't you see?,Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --,Would you like me to seduce you?
Yes, I do.,I've got to go.
Hello, Benjamin.,Oh. Hello. Hello.
He didn't see me.,Waiter!
Yes.,Well -- I don't know.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --,Well -- do you want to go up first?
Well -- goodbye then --,Benjamin.
Benjamin, is this your first time?,Is this -- what?
You can admit that, can't you?,Are you kidding?
Oh.,Don't you?
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.,What one.
What do you say to him?,He's asleep.
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.,Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
We're talking.,What?
Now let's keep going here.,Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Oh no. Are you kidding me?,No.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --,We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.,No.
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...,All right. Now let's get to bed.
Well how did it happen?,How do you think.
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?,Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
I'm curious.,We'd go to his car.
No.,Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?,Let's drop it.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --,Benjamin?
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?,I wouldn't know.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?,Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.,If that's how you feel --
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.,May I stay then?
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.,Then give me your word you won't.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.,Thank you.  Benjamin --
No -- actually I'm not --,I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.,What?
Nothing else.,Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.,Goodnight.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.,Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
Well --,About what?
I don't know. I want it to be --,To be what?
Have you thought about graduate school?,No.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.,No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.,That's a hell of a good age to be.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.,Yes, sir.
Hello.,What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?,Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
What's happening?,Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.,Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
I oughtn't to presume, but I --  I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!,Splendid!
Time's getting short.,I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.
I want to speak --,Not now.
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---,I could take care of her.
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --,You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
Whoever is keeping you waiting.,Have you seen it?
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --,Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Too bad.,Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?,Where downstairs?
Yes? -- Tomorrow?,Of course.
Yes -- I'd love to.,Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
You live here?,For tonight. 
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.,And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
Nothing -- only to be here.,Why do you hide in my room?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.,Because you love me -- you love me?
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?,I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
Yes -- tired...,So alone.
Strange man...,Am I quite strange to you?
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --,And...?
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.,I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
What can you see?,You are beautiful!
No.,Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.,I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
No?,When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
And what do you do -- now?,I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
I'll not denounce you.,I know.
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---,I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
Do you understand?,Yes -- yes -- yes.
I want to be good to you -- madly good.,Suzette will be back here in a minute.
Very early in the morning.,For Vienna?
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?,Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.,Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
On the train?,Yes -- I will be on the train.
The Baron is tired?,No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
Is that too much, Baron?,No -- not at all.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.,No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.,The war dropped him here and forgot him.
And the child isn't coming?,No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
Anyone asked for me?,Nobody, Doctor.
Any letters?,No, doctor.
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.,Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?,I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --,Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.,Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. ,More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
A man might what?,I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
You must look at my face and not at the floor.,Yes.
You dance splendidly.,I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?,What?
Do you like me better?,You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
Am I!,Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
What...! --,I'm the stenographer.
Moreover...,Moreover...
What is this?,I got ten marks for that.
You...,Me.
You...,Moreover...
Skiing? ,Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --,Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
No.,Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
Miss Flaemm.,Hello!
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.,Presently, Mr. Preysing.
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.,I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
Tomorrow morning.,No -- now.
Of course -- of course. ,A thousand marks -- 
Insolent young cub!,You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.,Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.,You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!,I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.,Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
No water -- What a place!,All you have to do is phone for it.
How clear is Manchester?,Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
Good morning, Suzette.,Good morning, Madam.
Hurry, Suzette.,Such nonsense.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --,Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
It is time for the performance.,The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 
Last night?... There was no applause.,There was -- there was.
Good morning, Pimenov.,Good morning, Gru -- your --
You're discharged.,Me?
Yes, the police must be called.,No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.,I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.,No news yet?
I know -- I know.,I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?,Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.,Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
Pretty as a picture.,Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.,You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?,I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--
One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?,I want to keep my teeth.
I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.,It'll never happen again. I swear.
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...,What's that, Lilly?
You're a thousand percent right!,Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.,Goody!
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?,Can't move.
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!,Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?,And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.,What? He's going to be all right!
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.,I know.
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.,But they must be! They cut glass!
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.,Lead on.
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?,Just myself.
Sounds like a good Idea.,I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --,I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?,Oh, sure. Fine.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.,I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
Oh, come on, Roy.,The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.,Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.,And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
Lucky? You call that lucky?,He let me live. He let me be his friend.
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.,That's right.
You ought to put a bandage on that.,No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.,I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.,Well, that's good news.
I just came back from Phoenix.,Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Myra followed you, huh?,She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --,Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.,You must have some money.
What?,I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.,And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
Well, uh...,Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.,And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?,A future. The only future I've got.
There's nothing more to talk about.,I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?,Always, for you, baby.
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.,Are you sure?
Look at me.,Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.,That's just Lilly's way.
No.,See you soon.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?,The long end. Big con.
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.,And when he got serious?
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.,And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
Upstate.,Upstate where?
Think about it. Okay?,Sure.
You were gone for a while.,I went out to Delmar.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.,But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
And hello to you, too.,I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
I don't think I need it.,You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
Don't I get any say in this?,No! Because I --
You watch that mouth.,I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
I realize this is a shock.,Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.,Gun?
Do you have any particular reason to say that?,My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...,Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
Where?,The cemetery...
That's it?,Care to join me?
Yes.,Sweet dreams, Blake.
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.,The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?,Detective...
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.,Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
My god...,Pretty messy.  Parents have already been notified.  Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
Think Eddie had something to do with it?,Doesn't look good.
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.,Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?,My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.,My office?
I promise not to run off to Cancun.,Forget it.
It's an option.,Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?,Yes.
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?,No.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...,Just get on the bus.
Oh, God... no... not Molly.,Please, get on the bus...
Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.,Where'd you get it?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.,You stole it?
What are you doing here?!,I came to see you.
Then I'll get caught.,Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
You really think Eddie killed her?,You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
You look kind of cold.,I'm okay.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.,Okay... thank you.
Linda!  He killed Linda!,Who?!
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?,Looks great.  It does.
It's John, isn't it?,It's always John.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.,Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
You aced it, didn't you?,I did alright.
Shane's going as a condom.,I thought you were allergic to latex.
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?,Why?  You interested?
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?,But I've seen him!
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...,You can't expect us to stay here --
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.,Jamie?  But I thought she was --
God ... this can't be true.,Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
My, God!  What have you done to him?,I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.,Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Halloween.,'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
Where's the baby?!,He's gone.
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!,That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.,But surely Rogers isn't --
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.,You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
There you are.  Who was that boy?,An old friend.
There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.,Any word on the location of the Strodes?
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.,Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?,I'll meet you over there.
No!!!,Stay away, Sam.
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!,Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
Miss me, baby?,I dunno, boy.
We've never met.,I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
Um.,Used to be against the law, didn't it?
I suppose.,Must have changed that law.
Home.,You know what gets me?
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.,After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!,Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
Months?,I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
And how were things?,Let's talk about something else.
I dunno, boy.,The educational process.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.,She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
What's funny about that?,You know me, boy.
Huh.,He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
Go to the funeral?,Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.,Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
I wanted to apologize.,You've come to the right man.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.,I forget mine for years on end.
What an awful sound!,Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?,What?
Gee whiz--,It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
You're my buddy.,Out!  Out!
Sir?,As a matter of fact--I am home.
Hello.,Hello.
Ask it!,Do you know who Wanda June is?
Life has denied me that thrill.,Do you mind if I ask who you are?
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?,I'll see.
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?,They're not engaged.
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.,Penelope!
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.,Will you go to bed?
What kind of exercise?,Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
What's this?,Nothing.
Gee whiz, Dad--,Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
"Hamburger Heaven.",Heaven.
What do you do for a living?,My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
Disease?,Situation.
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.,A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Your old beau?,We thought it was an emergency.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.,He's a very decent man, Harold.
When I'm dead--  or fucking.,Paul said you were awfully sick.
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!,He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!,It's so--so stark.
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.,You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.,Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!,What a honeymoon.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.,You're wrong.
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!,You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
Let me guess--breakfast is served?,No.
That's what you're supposed to say.,This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
It couldn't!,I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Fish can't feel.,Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
Such as?...,The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
I came for Paul as well.,If he wants to go.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.,I see.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.,May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
No.,No.
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?,There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?,You've killed women?
Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.,Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
We tried to be.  We tried to be.,He's dead, you know.
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.,We'll miss you so.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.,Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.,Ahh--then she's still alive.
She's fine.  Please--,And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.,I've literally got to run!
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.,Are--are you crying, Penelope?
None.,Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fianc is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?,I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
You've been bitten by bats?,Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.,I've never heard of it.
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?,You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
Don Quixote.,My violin is avenged!
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.,And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
No.,Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
Thank you--for my life.,It's trash now, like mine.
What are you going to do?,Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?,Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
It was a bitch.,Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
Dead!,Jesus.
Who's dead?,My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
What happened?,Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?,I heard you were looking for me.
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.,Ja?
Kid--kid--,And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!,I'll kill myself.
No.,All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.,He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
He's a ghost!,He's alive!
Not true.,Still lives with his mother.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.,I didn't know that.
Mom?,That man is your father.
I don't get it.,It is you, isn't it, Harold?
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.,Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.,I'm glad.
I'm touched.,That's when I'll get my confidence back.
Did you see him?,Yeah.
Is he all right?,Far as I know.
Is he coming home?,He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.,A what?
Possibly.,How long has this been going on?
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.,You're saying no.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.,Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.,Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.,No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.,What?
The what?,It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
What kind of a life is that?,He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.,And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.,We've got to rescue him.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.,He's not your son.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.,I believe in miracles now.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.,You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?,He died of a massive rupture.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.,You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.,We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
No, just not the type.,What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
No.,We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
I just want to ask some questions.,You may do that in the privacy of your room.
You want a tip?,Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
That's cool.,...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Just one.,The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
Is this all the display space we can get?,I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?,Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?,Sam?
Yeah.,Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
Are you the star of this picture?,You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
Are you Niki?,Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
Where is she?,Tod might know.
Are you a private detective?,Something like that. How much do you make?
You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.,At least I'm a growing person.
Say what?,'Sucking off.'
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?,You don't understand shit.
Is that the way it was with you?,No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?
No.,You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
Why? Are you a sex fiend?,No.
They were here?,Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
What the crap?,It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.,If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
It's not quite the same thing.,It doesn't make any sense to me.
Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.,Why can't I meet him now?
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.,What makes you so sure?
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...,So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
What happened?,Where is he?
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.,But then you'll forget about me.
Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.,Well, what do they know?
Andy.,...What do you have to offer?
I don't know.,What do you mean?
They're legal now.,They are?
Yeah. Probably.,You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
What are you doing here?,I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.,Does she know anything about this?
Is Marsha there?,Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.,That's not true, Mr...?
Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.,That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.,I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
You're talking about real excitement?,Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
Who told you about this?,Rucker.
Take it or leave it.,Okay.
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?',What we got is just these here.  What you see.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?,I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
But I...,I don't know nothing, man.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.,What exactly do you have in mind?
It's an investment.,If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
Sounds all right.,Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.,Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?,Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
The guy who bought you that ring.,Well, he can just fuck himself.
You can fuck off, too.,You're taking a big chance.
Eh, Poli Sci?,Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
Come again.,I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
Could I see your registration?,I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Took it?,Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Your tree.,Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Haven't we met before?,None of that, lady.
What do you want?,I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
Eh, no.,Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Oh, of course. What is your name?,Harold Chasen.
Yes.,Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.,It's very interesting.
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.,Oh, at the dentist's?
Me! No. Of course not.,Really. Do you think it's wrong?
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?,Yes. Very much.
It goes on and on.,That's really great.
What do you think?,Oh. Eh, I like it.
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?,What do you mean?
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.,Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
What is it?,That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
Oh, my. We're too late.,Is he all right?
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.,Look, the ice is melting.
What's that?,My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?,Well, I don't...
He's stopped.,The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
Well, I really don't smoke.,It's all right.  It's organic.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.,It's so blue.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.,Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
But they have.,Well, don't go.
But they'll put me in jail.,Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Do you think there is any life up there?,I don't know. Perhaps.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.,We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
You should have been a poet.,Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world.  What a joke it will be if like them I -
Yes.,Here.
... which I hope will make you very happy.,Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?,Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.,Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
I feel giddy.,But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.,Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.,What?
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?,At a funeral.
I'm going to marry the woman I love.,Harold!
Would you like a cigarette?,No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
And why is that?,Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
Fifteen.,A rough estimate.
Yes. It does.,Why?
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?,No.
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?,Yes.
Your studies?,Yes.
Then why did you leave?,I burnt down the Chemistry building.
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.,Thank you, Uncle.
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.,Yes, sir.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.,You think so, sir?
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.,Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
Harold, calm down! This is...,She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Stay where you are, Harold .,She took my head.
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?,Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Yes.,Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.
Frank.,I knew you'd come.
You knew?,Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?,Yes!
Yes... Yes. You look...,Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
I... I had a visitor.,What?
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...,Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
O.K. Let's go.,Kyle, you don't have...
But I didn't open it! I didn't!,Then why are you here?
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.,I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Don't get psychic with me.,Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?,I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.,Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
Do you believe in hell?,There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.,He's just going through a phase --
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!,That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
It's her choice --  She's human --,Oh, as opposed to -- ?
Got tired of me?,Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
That voice --,I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.,I can live with that.
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.,I knew those men better than you did --
We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...,Those things never work. Never.
Yup.,You never, ever light a cigar that way.
You're kidding --,Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
Helping you -- I just --,No one ever helps me. It's my job.
Myers??? How's your arm?,My arm is fine. Where are you??
What are you, a Boy Scout?,No. I never was.
You want me to hold him down?,That's right, Stud, hold me down.
Hey. You: think twice --,I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
Are you sure about this?,On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --,No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
Goodnight, then.,Goodnight.
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.,Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --,60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
Strong.,A brute.
Yes, I --,-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.,Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Just take it slowly.,Oh, sod you.
Christ!,What's the problem?
You fucking ass-holes.,Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.,It'll go in.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.,Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.,No!
Let me alone, will you?,No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?,I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
Just in time.,Stay the fuck away from me.
You were holding onto it like grim death.,I don't remember.
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.,No.
Come to Daddy.,This isn't happening.
I'm brother Frank.,Oh.
Help me.,Tell me who you are.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.,Good.
Later.,What?
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.,Not know.
This is what began it.,A box?
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.,Let me see.
So where's the harm?,I said no.
Maybe we should just leave --,Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
There's a towel in the bathroom.,Which is where?
You're still blaming me.,No. I'm not.
Larry!,I hear you.
He's here?,He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit.
You're NOT going to faint.,Shit.
It's probably going to need stitches.,I'm going to throw up.
Who was it?,Kirsty.
Huh?,Please...
What's wrong with you?,Please. I can't bear it...
Not much fun, is it?,What?
You know it's not often I... you know...,There's a first time for everything.
Well, isn't it?,I... suppose so, yes.
No, not much.,Let's keep it that way, shall we?
What a pretty tune.,My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
Kirsty?,I got through.
What did you say?,I said: I found a room.
Of course. Every day.,O.K.
Big house.,You like?
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.,Is Julia here?
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.,Surprise.
Yeah.,I love you, honey.
I guess.,She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
It's like she's waiting for something.,What?
PLEASE. You're in danger.,No. It's all over.
I won't be able to stand.,So lie down.
Need any help?,I AM house-trained.
Not that late.,Please. I want to see you home. All right?
I've been better.,Your father told me you were working here.
These THINGS... they want to take me --,What things?
What's wrong?,Don't let them take me, Steve --
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.,Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.,We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
I wanna date a musician...,I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
What did you tell her about the shop for?,I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.,Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?,Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.,Ha.
Shut the fuck up, Barry.,Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.,Suck my ass.
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.,You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
What's up?,Laura.  Her dad died.
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile.",Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.,You can be and are wrong.
A couple blocks!  About six!,We work there!
Don't do it, Rob!,He's not worth it!
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?,Pardon me?
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?,Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Great.,I'll tape it for you.
No, that's okay.  Really.,'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
What's this?,The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Are you all right?,Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.,Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
I dunno.,Think about it, Rob.
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.,I should be so lucky.
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.,Good.  So.  Is it my job?
It sounds stupid.,Nevermind.
Never?,I haven't felt like it.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?,No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?,I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.,You do, huh.
Ray.  I hate Ian.,I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
Sure they are.,They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
Hello.,Hey, how ya doin'?
Are you alright?,Pigsty.
Look, are you coming or not?,Yes, of course.
When are you going back?,I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.,It'll have to be sex, then.
Look, we can do other things.,I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.,Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.,But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
More confident, maybe.,Harder.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?,I'm alright.
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?,You're being stupid.
Nothing.,Wanna go to dinner?
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.,That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
About what?,This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?,I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.,It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.,How're you holding up?
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?,If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.,Good.
So you live in Chicago now?,Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
Hi, Marie.,Everything go alright?
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?,Yup.
You share a place with T-Bone?,No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
That way.,And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
Yeah?,Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
Great.  Super-fantastic.,How's the store?
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.,Well call her mother.
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?,I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
And after that?,Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?,He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.,Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
Thirteen hundred.,Seventy-five.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.,Records are those big round black things, right?
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?,Yeah.
I warned you.,Go to hell.
Happy birthday.,Thanks.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.,Then you didn't know Richard later on.
Have you spoken to anyone else about this?,There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
Would you remember his name?,Carl Smith.
This is against the rules.,So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
Grave robbers?,Probably.
Who?,People like that rarely leave business cards.
He called you "MacLeod".,Not your concern.
No.  I had to talk to you.,You had to do _nothing_!
You're wrong.,You're a fool.
You make it all sound so simple.,The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.,It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
No.  So what now?  We just wait?,Yes.
Maybe it would do us both good.,There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
You're using your son's name.,No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.,A factor of age.
He is older than I.,What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.,Of bodies.
I didn't kill the watchman.,You killed those other two.
I haven't killed _you_.,Is that a threat?
What is it?,I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
Get out.,No!
Forget it.,I'm just curious.
Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.,I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.,You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
Requiem acer'nam donaei-,What are you doing man?
You're not from these parts.,I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
I did at that.,And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
I'm twenty-two.,Not even a single lifetime.
It is as you are.,No!
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.,This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
It will take less effort as you learn.,It's like to kill me first.
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.,If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.,All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company.,I'll be back when I can.
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.,What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.,But I did live.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.,So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.,You're not talking sense, Mara!
Oh please.  Another one.,What would you like?
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?,Far away.
State of grace and all that.,Tradition.
Not so scared.,Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
No doubt.,You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
Finish your prayers?,Finish yours?
Complete your inspection?,They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
What is your position?,Second musketeer.
I understand you joined up in Bremen.,You seem to understand a great deal.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.,It can be different.  It must be.
My father taught me.,Your father must be smart.
The last four.,And the Bulgarian?
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.,He knows I'm here.  How?
_Answer_ me.,We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
How are you?,Head still secure to the neck.
And have you something to settle with me?,Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
I haven't drunk this much since-,-Since you last saw me.
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.,How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.,Leave her out of this.
We have some unfinished business.,Are you here?
Did you know the victim?,No.
What were _you_ looking for?,That's none of your business.
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.,A mystery.
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.,Do you?
All I need is time.,I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.,We were very close.
Nothing to be sorry about.,Just your pappy scared some.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?,Hildy!
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.,Open this door!
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.,Hello, Bensinger.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?,The poem?... The poem was great!
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears...",Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?,Seventy-five.
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!,Sort of a Jack London style?
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?,My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
Oh, it isn't like that.,It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?,He certainly -- hic -- does!
But --,Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?,Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.,Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
Did you finish the interview?,The Criminal Courts Building.
Hildy!,Hello, Bruce...
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?,Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Oh, she was here.,Where'd she go?
Did you give her the money?,No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.,Oh, yes. Here it is.
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?,No -- she didn't.
Mother? But your mother --,No. My mother.
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.,I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
Well, I'll try to give her one.,I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Just for the first year.,That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
How long would the interview take?,Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.,Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
I feel I ought to take care of her.,Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.,Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.,Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.,So long.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?,She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.,The money? Why?
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?,You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.,You'll ask me to what?
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.,You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.,You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!,The power of the press, huh!
Save that for the Tribune.,What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
What do you want?,Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.,Now, that's a nice thing to say.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?,Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
What do you mean by that?,Just what I said. That's what I --
You mean you're not coming back to work here?,That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --,I know, Walter, but I --
Sweeney.,Dead?
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!,Please! Will you just --
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?,I'm not working for any other paper!
Bermuda.,Bermuda... Rich, eh?
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.,Say, could I meet him?
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.,You're not afraid, are you?
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.,Thank you.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?,Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!,You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!,What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.,We're not interested.
Exclusive? That's great.,It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!,Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?,Yes. Where is he?
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.,Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?,Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!,Okay, Walter. 
Railroad tickets.,Is he coming back here?
Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!,I'm finished.
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?,I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!
Look at me, Hildy --,I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!,Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
Hello -- hello...,Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?,Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!,Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!,Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
Lafayette two-one-hundred.,That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
Ring that number, will you?,Come here. See if we can move it.
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --,Will you come here?
No, you don't! Walter!,What is it? Here!
How was that for a tight squeeze?,Don't tell me you were worried!
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?,Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!,Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
Then why are you doing it?,Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.,What's the matter with my brains?
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.,Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!,You grey-haired old Judas!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.,I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
You know me. The shirt off my back.,You got plenty of money?
Sure, boss.,I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!,Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. 
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?,I think it is.
How much?,Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
They're always after me for interviews.,Me, too.
I don't know --,Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?,In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?,Yes, sir.
Well, that about covers everything.,Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
Who locked the door?,Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
She says she's gonna write fiction.,Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
Boy, did you see her go?,Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
Gus, this --,Good coffee, isn't it?
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.,You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
Just a minute, Johnson!,Let go o' me. What's the idea?
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.,What?
He's harmless.,Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
For who?,Earl Williams. The reprieve.
Did you actually give Williams that gun?,The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.,Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
Pure politics!,An attempt to ruin us!
What is it?,They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
Shoot to kill, I said.,I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.,Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.,If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
That's a lie!!,I never saw him before!
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.,I was just going to!
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.,Editorials?
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! ,All right, Judge.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.,What's the matter? Getting yellow?
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.,Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Did you get that, Hildy?,No -- what?
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?,Huh?
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!,Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?,What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
Any dope yet on how he got out?,From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.,What are your beliefs, Earl?
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?,No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.,Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.,Keep away!
Where are they gone? You know where they are?,Wait a minute, Mollie.
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?,Forty dollars.
Who? Me?,Who do you think!
This puts me in a peculiar hole.,No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
Look out!,Look out where you're aiming, will you?
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.,Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
What's your hurry?,We want to see you.
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --,-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right. ,Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?,Why?
Do you know any swear words?,Yes.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.,Won't they have maps?
Tell them about Pauline's mum.,Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.,It's easy. I've done it.
I did see them. I did.,He's the worst liar.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.,...and four and five...
Can't we just see the end?,They've got the real thing outside.
You said that last year, Dad.,The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
What's that?,Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
Wow!,They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
Who pays for them?,We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
What is it?,We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
You do, you do. You're just not saying.,I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!,Please yourself.
No Turks.,We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
Has Sue got it right?,What's that?
You joined up.,Oh, that.
We don't know anything about it,Well, it's off ration. We know that.
What are you going to be then?,A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
He always knows.,Half the time he's bluffing.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.,The ideas you get in your head.
And where do you think you're going?,Out.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.,No, I won't.
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.,There, there, my baby.
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.,Who said anything about love?
What did he say?,He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
It looks a bit fishy to me.,Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.,Grace!
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?,A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.',Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
I wish it could all have been different.,Look after yourself, Grace.
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.,Father, that's enough now
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.,Yikes.
Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.,Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
Tiny's home.,What about R.J.?
Drink up, it's party time.,Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
What about the tree?,Oh yeah, the tree.
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.,OK.
Is your brother ready to go?,Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?,No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.,Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
That's not something to joke about.,OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
Why? You gonna do something about it?,Yeah, I'll do something.
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.,Holy crap, thanks!
Come on, bro. Let's go.,Hey, wait take this.
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.,I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
No, no I think it's really interesting.,Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
She's pretty cute.,Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.,Yeah, no shit.
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?,I don't know.
It's a hitchhiker.,Way out here?
What was that?,Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.,I'll help ya.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.,And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.,Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Just grin and bear it.,That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.,What?
Forget it. I'll just go.,Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.,What I need are some answers. 
How's about you give me those same directions.,Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.,Hmmmmm.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.,Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
How long is that gonna take?,He should be back in a couple hours.
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.,I don't want to see that.
Yeah?,These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
Thank you.,Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
Really, now is not the time to make waves.,Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
What are you laughing at?,I don't know, I think he's funny.
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.,Shhhhhh.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!,Help, help us.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.,Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.,Tell me about it.
Don't even say it.,You got to be fucking joking.
How long has it been?,I don't know... about half an hour.
I don't hear anything.,Shhhhhh, quiet.
Jesus Christ.,I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?,Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
A couple hours!,Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Recover any bodies?,Not yet.
Oh, right.,What do they call you, sweety?
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.,Firefly.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.,What!
Where's Bill?,Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
Where is he?,Let's go see.
Fuck you, you fucking freak!,Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
Well hello, officer.,Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.,No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Tell it to my daughter.,Shit... fuck procedure.
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.,I pray to God there is.
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.,Right.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.,Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
I guess not.,That must be him.
Wydell.,Excuse me for a second.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.,Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
Tell him, Harold.,Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.
Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.,Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?,Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
You remind me so much of Nathan.,Like father, like son.
As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?,Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?,Oui, doctor, oui.
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?,Oui.
You decide. Today is your day.,Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.,I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?,Yes. Happy happy.
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.,Shit.  Hi, honey.
Fine.,Not in front of the boy.
Anyway. Come already to the point.,I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
Hunh.,Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.,Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.,We still have you and I.
Very well.,Very well.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.,Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
Progress!,Ouch. Yeah?
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.,I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
My brother is discreet.,Won't he be able to tell?
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.,God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.,I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.,I have a friend you might like to meet.
Oh?,Three foot one.
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?,Lila, it's Rosie.
Your brother should have his license revoked.,Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.,Oh, Rosie.
I'm going to miss you.,Oh, Rosie.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.,Shut up, you.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.,I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
It looks wonderful.,You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.,It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
You do?,Yes, and...
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...,I like you, too, Nathan.
Shaving cream?,I don't think so.  Why?
Oh, and the sun block?,Of course.
What SPF, sweetie?,Fifteen.
Did you see that?,What?
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!,He looks perfectly fine.
It's perfect!,Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...,All right.
What are you doing in there?,Nothing. Be right out.
Who is it?,Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Who is it?,Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...,You have to shave? Like an ape?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!,Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.,Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.,Of course not.
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...,...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.,How come?
You just have to control it. We're not apes.,Thank you very much for that.
Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances.,Absolutely!
Look at you two. You both disgust me.,Oook. Oook.
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.,Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
Oh boy!,Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.,Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.,Got it.
You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.,No.
Boys just passing through?,Yep.
About sixty, seventy bucks.,Next game, ten bucks.
I want to talk to you.,Do we need words?
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.,You know what's good for him?
I'll make it up to you.,How?
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?,That's the way it's done.
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.,Deal the cards.
Will you take a check, Bert?,Cash.
Make it twenty.,Cut.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.,Two.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?,Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?,A thousand.
Seventy-five per cent.,For who?
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?,There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.,I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.,How good is he?
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.,I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Fine.,Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
Sure.,You hustlin' me?
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.,Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
I wanna walk.,It's a long walk.
Tell her what?,You gotta be hard, Eddie.
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!,And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
Yeah, that's right.,Want some free advice?
You got that wrong, mister. I am.,Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.,Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.,Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.,I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?,Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
How much we got?,Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?,Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy.",Talk to me, Charlie.
I want you to come back on the road with me.,Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?,Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
With what?,Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
Yeah, to play Fats again.,You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.,How much?
Yeah. You must come again.,Yeah. Sure.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.,Okay, friend.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?,Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
You quittin', friend?,Yeah, I'm quittin'.
It's the lights. And the scotch.,How come you didn't catch your bus?
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?,Around.
Yeah? What do you do now?,I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
I could always get us a bottle.,No.
A day like any other. People come, people go.,Give me a drag.
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?,Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.,You want to go with me?
You got it all in your head?,When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
What did all this stuff cost you?,When you've got money, you'll pay.
Don't you ever cook anything?,Eggs. How do you like them?
You going out?,Yeah. For a little while.
Give it to me.,What's this supposed to mean?
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.,What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Well, he owns things.,Is that what makes a winner?
Well, what else does?,Does it bother you? What he said?
Well, what's so funny?,Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
What do you want to tell me?,Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.,I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
Where's Bert?,He went off someplace.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.,Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.,You watch me.
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.,I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
...you shoot a great game of pool.,So do you, Fast Eddie.
That is not now, human!,My name is Robert.
It is not arguing to speak the truth.,Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
What about... now?,With them?
What do you want?,What do you mean?
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.,We don't know that --
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?,Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?,Yes.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.,Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --,Virginia...?
So, what do you do?,I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
Son ... are you awake?,Yes.
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.,I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
What's that, Dad?,That's the Air Force Base.
There are more this year than last.,This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.,Was there anything over the hill?
It was so real, Dad.,It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.,I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
Where's your car?,I left it at work.
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.,I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.,I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!,I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.,I don't see anything.
Damn.,I know a way.
What is it?,I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...,Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.,There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
You're looking for life?,They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
George, where have you been?,What happened to your other slipper?
Your father asked you a question.,What? -- I... 
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?,Why, yes.
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.,All right.  I'll be right back.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.,We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.,Think nothing of it, Spanky.
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?,More than likely.
We're losing them.,Then get them out of there.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?,It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?,Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.,And the good news is you won't charge me.
Not really...,That signal. It's a countdown.
A countdown to what?,Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
Then what?,Checkmate.
You still got the Olds?,You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.,They don't know this.
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?,She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...
Perfect, she's using it.,It's perfect the line is busy?
You punched the President in the face?,He wasn't the President then.
Pops, you're a genius!,What'd I say?
We're loose!,Doesn't matter. Game's over.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?,Then God help us.
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.,But Mr. President...
Is my wife in the air?,She should be shortly.
How're we doing?,Better than we thought.
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.,And our troops here?
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.,This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?,It had been deemed classified.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.,They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.,Yes, I am.
Dick-weed!,Butt-munch.
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...,I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
I shouldn't have left her.,Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
I don't need it.,Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!,People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.,And I am his.
My reputation precedes me.,There is no museum in Iskenderun.
Dad?,It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.,Alexandretta. Now we know.
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?,Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.,I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
Where did this come from?,My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever.",The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
You could be more right than you know.,Yes?
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.,You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?,As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.,Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.,Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
Fraulein -- will you permit me?,I usually don't.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.,Lower me down.
Don't wander off.,What?
I said go around!,You said go between them!
Uh-huh.,You had it? You didn't trust me!
No. You like the way I do things.,It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
No, Dad. You listen to me --,Junior!
But what are you doing here?,I came to get you! What do you think?
Oh, it breaks the heart.,And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.,Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Dad, they come in through the doors.,Good point.
If only I could have been with you.,There were rats, Dad.
You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?,Well, uh...
You did!!,Look, can we discuss this later?
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.,Will you take it easy!
No! Don't Shoot!,Don't worry. He won't.
How did you she was a Nazi?,She talks in her sleep.
I ought to tell you something.,Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.,All right Dad -- tell me.
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.,But what are they? Can't you remember?
What did you get?,I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.,Relax.
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!,Dad, we're well out of range.
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass.",The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
I like Indiana.,We named the dog Indiana.
I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.,Who are you?
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.,That was seven hundred years ago.
Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.,Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
Interested in local curios?,No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.,You think so?
What?,We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.,You should have been there...
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".,No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.,Yes, I understand.
You have insulted my son.,Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
What you look at, Indy?,Just a statue.
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!,Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?,They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!,Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!,Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?,Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.,He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.,Somehow I feel safer in here.
Don't let it pull you deeper!,It's pulling me deeper!
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.,What?!
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!,Keep stroking it!
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?,I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.,He'll be okay. He's a good kid.
I'd like to find one of those myself.,Oh really?
Couldn't keep away, huh?,Just try and control yourself.
He's afraid of something.,He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?,Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
Oh no -- oh no!!,You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
What?!,Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!,Willie!
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!,No... the heart's still beating!
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!,I'm not leaving without those stones.
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.,No... they won't kill me.
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!,What above the curves?!
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!,What's going on?
Arrrgh!,It wasn't him.
You're in my head...,Yes.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?,Where are we?
Quit screwing around, this is important.,It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.,Me? What'd I do?
Are you crazy?,Yep.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?,Yeah.
Why he's argumentative?,Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
You weren't listening!,Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
I'll talk to them.,Oh...Gooood!
I'll tell you what to say.,If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
Anyone there?,No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Now what?,Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.,Can't see a Goddamn thi..
Calm Down! Act rational.,How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
Just walk down the hall?,With Authority!
A lab and equipment.,Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?,I can't remember..
Gone where?,Don't know.
It's illegal.,Who cares?
I'll get in trouble.,You are in trouble. Now do it.
...and a license to kill...,Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
Do you notice anything.,The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?,You eat it.
Now what?,The sand.
Which language?,How should I know?
What happened?,...Rene...
Now, where would I be?,What are you looking at?
They both look good to me.,You have no taste.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.,What glasses.
Just don't show fear.,I don't know what's going on.
Joe, be careful!,...I've lost something. I must get it back.
What is it?,You can't listen. You can't watch either.
What Happened?,I don't know!
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..,Is that all?
What do I do?,Follow her.
Sapporo..,Just stay here and rest.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.,You think. That's what you're good at.
Don't touch a thing.,Don't worry!
Door to the right. Get up and run.,I can't see a thing.
What was it? What'd I say?,You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
Do something.,What exactly?
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.,You're lovely.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.,I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.,That's nice.
JOE What abilities...?,Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
Not that truth!,Aren't we all.
I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.,Do what? What'd you do?
What is your name?,Don't give her your name.
I knew you were trouble.,Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
Impossible.,I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
You didn't tell us you were coming?,Then how did you know?
How about a deal?,We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.,He work for us?
Who is your friend?,We met on the beach.
Enough ROmance.,He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
I don't want to intrude.,We insist.
Al Viola.,That name's familiar.
What brings you here?,I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
You may not remember things.,What things?
Right.,Who...are you?
Who?,I don't know Who.
Al?,The little man in my...  ...head...
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.,Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Don't do it!,Just give me the keys.
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!,Sir?
Blake said that?,Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
Let you leave without it.,Without what?
...and sort of...disinterest.,Disinterest?
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.,Why do you do it?
If I was with you, I wouldn't,You did.
And how'm I doing?,You're doing...Okay.
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?,...Naw. Made that up.
Who do you work for?,No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Joe! What happened to you?,Why'd you run off?
Who else is interested in me?,What do you mean?
What did you tell them?,There's not much to tell.
Were you working for him last night?,Last night?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?,No, he didn't do that.
He didn't.,No.
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?,I'm just on vacation.
You know where he went?,What's he done?
We're very close.,What'd he steal?
Hiroshima.,Get your things.
Then why are you smiling like that?,Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
Who was?,Ryuji and Gruner.
What?,He plays it all the time.
Now what?,We figure out if it's in here.
If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?,Hong Kong.
I know the territory.,You coming along?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.,He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
What?,They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
Just like that?,I'll come back for you.
He can't help us.,Do something!
Come on.,That's twenty feet high.
Yeah...I have to get away.,I know a nice island.
What could you find in this place?,...Piece of mind.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.,Thanks.
Wait.,Why?
Right there.,Thank you.
Ow?...,It'l be alright.
It will.,It doesn't hurt.
It'l take months.,So we better get started.
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?,Okay.
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.,She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
Hey, baby. What's wrong?,What's that outside, Daddy?
He's into kind of little cars, that...,That remote control thing?
Yeah.,Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Mom.,Yes, baby?
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?,Lowell?
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.,Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?,Because he has to reveal it in a court of law. It's on record, it's out. It's no secret anymore. So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? It's out in the world...
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...,...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
What are you cooking?,I'm cooking pasta primavera.
Yeah, I heard rumors.,It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?,Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!,C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
A gun? Yes.,What caliber is your gun?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?,If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
You can't take that... It's personal property...!,We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.,Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.,Okay.  Lowell?
Why?,Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
Is there any more rice...?,Yes, it's on the stove...
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?,Try the car.
Right now?,That's my stuff from the office...
...taping?  What are you taping?,I'm doing an interview.
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --,Did you say Berman?
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...,"60 Minutes"?
Yeah.,"60 Minutes," the television show?
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?,...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
What?!,They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.,You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
Yeah...,...you fucked me!
Area code 212-555-0199.,I'll call you then.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.,What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?,Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...,Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
We're there.,Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
Yeah.,Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...,What "Seven Dwarfs?"
Oh, man.,Who are these people?
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.,Good.
Lowell.,"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
Lowell!,What?
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.,I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.,I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
That Canada story? Still interest you?,Everything interests me.
C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...,I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
I know what I have to know.,Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?,Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
Did work.,Did work.
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!,And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.,They're afraid of you, aren't they?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?,Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
Seven dwarfs?,The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?,I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?,Good.  You have kids?
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.,You believe that?
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.,You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!,I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
Jeff...,They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
You attract a crowd.,Yeah, great.
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...,I don't know what to do.
I told the truth!,Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...,She sued you for back payments of child support?
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?,What?
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?,What does this have to do with my testimony?
Did he hear you?,You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.,Well, what do you really think, though?
What do you mean there is no family?,Liane has filed for divorce...
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...,Where you staying now?
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.,Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.,Right.
Poor communication skills.,And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
Object!,There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...,Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...,Chapter and verse.
"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...,That's why we hire scientists...
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --,Well, I wouldn't say --
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --,They hate each other --
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?,Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?,Here. Got pictures.
You're in a rush.,Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
That's his lawyer.,Triple!
Objection, your honor!,Grounds?
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.,So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
I don't need it.,You want Botox?
What the hell is Botox?,It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
It was a gift from a client.,Set one side for Bel Air.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.,We did not.
You're in check.,I should be in therapy.
I'm happy for you, pal.,Thanks, buddy.
I have it.,You have the pre-nup?
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?,No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.,Yes?
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?,Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
Marylin! What have I done?,I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
You like kids.,I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.,Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
Is Tong older than Ming?,I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
It sounded like a bell.,I'll be right back.
These are yours.,Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
I assume this is on Rex?,Isn't everything?
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.,"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.,You just haven't met the right person.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.,Gotcha.
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.,And you've always loved him?
He'll regret this.,Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.,So I hear. Is that all?
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.,Miles. Miles. Miles.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --,You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
Screw you, asswipe!,Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?,Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
Hmmm...,And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
Friends?,Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...,No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
Good.  Are those foods?,Fabric and fringe.
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --,Miles.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!,May I come in?
I'm reporting you to the IRS.,The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.,That's blackmail.
Hello?,Marylin?
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --,No buts. Now. Out.
Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.,That's true.
Hello Marylin.,Hello Miles.
You wounded me first, Marylin.,Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
Hello, Rex.,Marylin.
Are you alright? You lost weight.,My whole metabolism is -- off.
Do you need a Tagamet?,You have some?
Maybe.,We do have a man for you.
Lilly's up.,Oh, God!
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.,I want to be exposed.
What?,He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!,I guess.
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.,He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
Wait. I know you.,Yes?
Mr. Massey --,Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
That's delusional.,My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.,My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Ah.,You know what I mean when I say "it."
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.,Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
And she had private investigators assisting her.,She brought my digestive enzymes.
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!,HA!
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.,The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.,You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.,I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
How is she?,Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in,If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!,Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.,You were taken for a buggy ride?
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?,A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!,I asked you a question. Do you love her?
You talk as if he were a gigoloor something.,Never mindI'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.,I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Ridiculous!,He doesn't think so much of you either.
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.,I'm sorry you read it.
What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?,Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
What would you like to have me do?,Sock her!
We've done that already.,Yes, of course.
What happened?,I haven't the slightest idea.
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.,Any others?
Don't want to talk todon't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.,But it's King Westley on the phone.
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.,There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New Yorkand if we didn't go, she might lose it.,Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.,Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
What happened?,That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.,Why, you ungrateful brat!
My ticket?,I found it on the seat.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.,You must have me confused with
Here, boy!,What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.,Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
Your ego is colossal.,Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.,Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. ,Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but you've been very kind. 
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came firstthen the tiethen the shirtnow, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I,Smart aleck!
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.,Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.,I can't go out like this.
Must be the Spring.,I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.,One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.,Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Oh, so now I was drunk!,Well, you were!
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.,I refuse to resign!
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.,At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
I wish you'd stop being playful.,Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
You're crazy.,remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride
And he carried you like this, I suppose.,Yes.
Not a one.,You're prejudiced.
What's got into you?,Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
Sure.,What?
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?,Clever.
You! Don't make me laugh.,You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a carand I won't use my thumb.
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?,Come onget in.
What happened?,Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
What'd you give him for the car?,A black eye. 
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.,Darling!
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.,Do you know?
No harm in your coming to see us.,Not interested. 
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busI told them to wait!,Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
In about fifteen minutes.,Thank you.
You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.,Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
But I don't go in for that kinda stuffmuch. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. ,Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
Heyyou not up yet? Come oncome on!,What time is it?
I'm hungry.,Just your imagination.
Up yonder. See the lights?,Yeah.
Mr. Gordon,Huh?
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?,What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this officeunless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
Okay, Joe. Listenyou know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnanytime I ran into a story that looked goodI always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.,You mean about the Andrews' kid?
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.,Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
I'd put you there myself.,Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.,Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Yeah, where am I?,When you sober upcome in and see me.
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.,Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
Listen, manI'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?,ain't got a hat
What?,I ain't got a hat.
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!,Who?
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.,That's right.
Five G'sor I crab the works.,You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?,Whyno
Yeah ?How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.,You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.,You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
What was his voice like?,You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?,There were no phone records.
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.,I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.,God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
Bill.,Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome.",Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.,Go on, Willie.
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?,The anonymous kind, Chief.
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?,At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
All right, all right.  Break it up.,Where you going, boss?
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?,There's a word - orders.
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!,So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?,Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...,This is Louisiana, chief.  How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one.  Jim sighs, saddened.  Bill was one of his best men.
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?,Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?,No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?,Calm down, Dave, what?
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?,They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.,But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.,Why Galveston?
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.,And then Sunday?
I believe the boys got a couple.,But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Why?  What's wrong?,Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?,You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
And Shaw?,Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?,I had the cause of death.
Daddy!  Where have you been?,Hi, Freckle Face.
Are we going away, Daddy?,Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:,Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.,And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
I don't believe it!,Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?,You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...,Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?,That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?,Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
Honey, go back to sleep, please!,Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.,It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
Did they live?,It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!,Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.,How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.,Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.,You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
Oh no!... How bad?,No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
I know David - a strange character.,He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
Post Office.,Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.,I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. ,We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.,How many men?
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?,Who?
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.,I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.,Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Some people would say you're paranoid.,Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.,Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?,If you buy what you read in the paper.
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?,Was he there often?
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.,We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?,I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?,If you must know, virtually nothing.
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?,Yes?
Do you walk home?,Uh huh.
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?,Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
What are they?,Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
But then you told her you were home.,Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?,I'll call her.
Won't forget?,I won't forget.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?,That's not what they're tellin' me.
What?,I need a favor.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --,Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
Uh-huh.,I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --,Let me finish. Can I finish?
Look, man, I know I owe you --,Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
What's she willing to give us?,She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?,Take your time.
You don't want much, do you?,Can you do it or not?
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.,What's her name?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?,She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
Who put up my bond? Ordell?,In cash.
Can we stop for cigarettes?,Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.,What's your brand?
You're not tired of it?,I am, as a matter of fact.
That would be Beaumont Livingston.,That's him. How do you know 'em?
Same as you. Ten thousand.,The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
He's the one who wants you.,It was the other guy who busted me.
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.,Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
'76?,'74, I think.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.,Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
He came by.,What?... What'd you do?
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?,No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
It's different with men.,You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
Does something else worry you?,I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
Fifteen thousand.,Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
What about you Max?,What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.,A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
Got another gun and a stun gun...,And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
What do you do when he comes home?,Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
You do that?,That's my job.
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...,What if I've figured a way?
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.,Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Where's the rest of it?,In the bag underneath.
What if he checks it?,He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?,It's not that simple.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.,Did you tell him you were leaving?
That's Ordell's.,They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
I never lied to you.,I know.
Wanna go?,Thanks, but you have a good time.
I know what it looks like.,You planted that shit on me.
Oh, so now you know him?,You never asked me if I did or not.
How can you help us?,Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...,A Broadway shopping bag.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.,You talk to him?
I imagine shit needs to be done.,We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.,I was told ten thousand in each pack.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?,I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
Sure.,Great...  ...Wanda!
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.,Beaumont Livingston?
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?,I was expecting you. Come in.
I got some vodka in the freezer.,Got some o.j.?
This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?,They told me.
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.,The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.,I said, you understand what I'm saying
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.,I do okay.
You told em? You told em it's me?,They already know it's you.
Didja tell 'em anything else?,I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
You told them that?,It's true, isn't it?
What the fuck's that got to do with it?,They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...,But you don't?
Can you cover that?,I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.,How do you know she did that?
Are you sure she don't know about the money?,She don't know shit about the money.
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.,Designer clothes.
Who's paging you?,Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.,Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
How long?,Two months shy of four years.
Four years?,Uh-huh.
You okay?,Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.,It's a diet thing?
Were you a disco girl?,Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
Wanna fuck?,Sure.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...,Uh-huh?
We're leaving now!,All right already.
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.,Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Is it this aisle or the next one over?,This one.
I'm going to wait in the car.,Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
Uh-huh.,C'mon in.
What did he do?,He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.,When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
You shot Melanie?,Twice. In the parking lot.
You shot her twice?,Uh-huh.
Then what?,We went to the parking lot.
Where you shot her.,That's right.
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.,If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
You know who I saw in the dress department?,Tell me.
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.,How am I supposed to know that?
I'm going out for a few hours.,Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
How can I help you?,Where would you like me to put my ash?
That's Winston. He works here.,He's a big one. You two tight?
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?,Gonna have to put up cash.
Who's it for? A relative?,Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
Ten thousand sounds high.,They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
What's his full name?,Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
Beaumont Livingston.,Livingston, huh?
Do you know what he's on probation for?,Haven't a clue.
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.,Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
Comfortable?,The door was opened, so I just came right in.
I can see that. Why?,I got some more business for ya.
Somebody already did.,What?
You didn't hear?,Hear what?
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.,Did the police contact you?
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?,You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?,Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
I got it. I just don't got it on me.,Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.,If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Where is it?,Is that what I think it is?
What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?,I thought you might be asleep.
I'm alone.,Git your ass in here.
How'd you find me?,Winston found you.
She's all alone.,I call your office, she better answer the phone.
You sure?,Yes.
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.,We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
He's around.,Give me his home number.
Take me home.,Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
I'm alive.,Then what are you doing here?
It's all been a dream.,No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain.  Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!
Dream on!,No! Oh God.
Are you all right?,I'm okay.
Grass never did that to me.,You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.,Me, too.
What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?,He was upset. He thought people were following him.
Hello.,Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?,That's right. We did.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.,There's nothing to expose.
Hey, wait!,Don't bother to call again, okay?
Doctor.  Ph.D.,Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.,You need ... a doctor.
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.,But the paper ...
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.,What else did he say, Jake?
He say what they looked like?,No. Not really ...
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.,How do you know?
A bit.,What did she have to say?
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.,She talk about the boys?
I don't know. I've been having them recently.  You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?,Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons.,Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.,Hell, you think I am?
It's not healthy with it closed.,This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.,I thought you said it was a nightmare?
Jacob, what can I do?,Save me!
I moved the couch. That's all.,Where to?
What happened to you?,Don't ask.
Did you look around the headboard?,Jezzie, I can't see.
Who? Jed?,No. The little one.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.,Well, personally, I never went for church names.
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?,You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
What do you mean you can see?,Look at her face. A real bitch.
She looked good then.,Not to me.
Ready?,Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.,They're like demons, Jez.
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.,Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
What do you mean? Where do you think?,Where's Della? Bring her here?
What does it say?,It's gone to the top.
What'd the doctor say?,That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.,You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
I can't do it.,What kind of man are you?
While you were in the shower.,Why didn't you call me?
It's just me.,Jezzie?
Please.,No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?,It's over, Jake. It's all over.
What's going on?,Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
Jake, what is it?,I'm tired.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?,I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Where's West? New Jersey?,Don't be funny.
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.,Shows how much you knew.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.,Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.,The Ladder?
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.,If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
You come here often?,Sometimes. When it's convenient.
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.,Never?
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.,One drop?
I think I'm falling asleep.,Pleasant dreams.
I would have stayed there if I could.,I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.,They're awfully heavy.
How was Palm Springs?,Hot. Where do I sign?
He's burning up.,Total delirium.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.,Push 'em back.
Please come quietly.,You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
Clear the area. This is an order!,What is wrong with you?
We're doing everything we can.,Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.,Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
I'm sorry.,Last night! They were as real as you are!
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?,I need to see you, Jake.
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.,What's wrong?
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?,They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
The army?,She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
I don't know. I don't know.,They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
No one knows. They say it blew up.,Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
On top of him?,He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
Goodbye old friend.,Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
What's that?,THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.,Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Where the hell were you?!!,He came for me, I had to run!
Everyone okay?,I think I broke my arm.
We're not supposed to do that.,What are you gonna do, tell me?
I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.,Thorgan? You coming?!
Then what do we do?!,I don't know!
Hurry!,Faster! Don't we have another gun?
It bought us some time.,And now we're all out of it.
Get them in the lab!,Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.,Not a chance.
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.,You got that right.
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.,At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.,No, you're dead! You're all dead!
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.,Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
We need weapons.,Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.,Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!,Fuckin A...
Where is everybody? What happened?,Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.,Guys!!! The shuttle?
That's why I'm here.,So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.,Were you close to your father?
See? We're not so bad.,Not so bad.
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.,You?
You wanna release your air tanks?,Okay, good tip.
Delongpre, you don't even know me.,I know you.
Rizzo, pull away!,I'm stuck!
Now what?,We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
Spunky . . .,She broke my fucking nose!
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.,I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?,Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.,They'll make it.
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.,I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
You're so bossy.,You're leaving me here alone?
Jesus!,Oh my God! Adrienne?
I don't know...sorry?,Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.,Are there any other shuttles?
Sorry, sorry.,Who are you apologizing to?
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.,A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
Kay-em you okay?,I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
Kicker!,Defense droids. I'm on it.
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.,Obviously so.
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...,JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.,Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Azrael can you repeat that?,Get him out of there!
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?,Hockey player? He's not a ...
Son! -- Out of the water now!,My boat's neat, dad!
My cars. And a comic book.,Here --  Take him home.
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.,You got it.
That's it! Radio in for help!,Shut up! Just pump her out!
What about us?,Have to pump her steady, s'all.
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!,I never hear the whistle.
Love ya.,Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.,I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
Home... New York?,No. Home here.
Who's that young man?,Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.,Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.,Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.,My kids were on that beach...
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?,No, it was local jurisdiction.
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?,No, we just checked the beach...
Dynamite!  How was your day...?,Swell.
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?,You could say that.
How can you tell?,Florida license plate.
Where'd you get all this?,I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?,It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
What happened?,I want to check something. Hold my feet.
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...,That means closing the beaches.
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!,I can't stand here doing nothing!
Think the tide's with us?,Just keep kicking.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...,I can't imagine why.
Christine what?,Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
You picked her up on the ferry.,I didn't know her.
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.,Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
You wanna call it a night after here?,It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Would you like something? Some coffee?,Is anyone having this...?
What have you got there, Lenny?,We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?,Anti-Shark cage.
What's that supposed to prove?,Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
That's pilot whale, isn't it?,It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.,Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.,Ever see one like this?
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.,I think I can top that, Mister...
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?,I don't have it.
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.,Thanks for the message.
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.,I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
Well! Nothing like experimenting.,I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
Charisma?,Or something.
Is that normal?,I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?,Um, hi?
Leah just told me you were going with her.,Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!,Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.,You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
You know it's okay.,Also, I think I'm in love with you.
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.,Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
Wizard!,I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
Just like our moms and teachers!,Yup.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.,I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
What is your job title, exactly?,Excuse me?
I have no idea how to spit this out.,Hon, did you get expelled?
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?,It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.,Geeeerta Rauuuss!
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.,Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
Am I supposed to feel happy now?,You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Like what?,Commercials.
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?,Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
Oh really? What's the verdict?,I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.,Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Wow. That shirt is working hard.,Is Vanessa here?
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!,Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.,Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
What?,I actually know this one.
You do?,Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
But I thought you'd be cool if...,I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.,Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
Uh, hi Su-Chin.,Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?,No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
You should try Adderall.,No thanks. I'm off pills.
Can I take your coats?,Sure.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.,Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...,Room with a toilet, got it.
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?,Nothing...
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.,I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.,Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?,Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.,No thank you. I'm off sex.
Who is the kid?,The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
What?,Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?,Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
Excuse me?,Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
Yeah, like people in love.,Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Dad, no!,Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?,I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.,I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.,That is sick, man.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?,Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!,Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!,I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.,Keith's hot.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.,Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?,They're yellow.
What did you do?,I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
She answered our prayers.,Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
We're actually, finally doing this?,Looks like it, yeah.
A hotel?,It's a loft.
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.,Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
What?,Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?,I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?,Sure.
You took this picture?,Took 'em all.
Adele... are you serious?,You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.,What's Early been in jail for?
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.,Jeez... Adele!
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?,Almost.
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.,I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
What if they're dangerous?,They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
Shush, Adele.,Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.,I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?,That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?,Dahlia, no.
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?,Yeah.
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.,No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!,...Ha.
So tell me... what happened here?,Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
...and?,They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?,He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.,Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
What's that?,A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
Brian I want him out of our car!,Why, what did he do?
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.,I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
Any word from that gallery?,Not yet.
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?,...Brian hurt his foot.
You were plenty hot.,You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.,What is it?
How old you?,17.
Yes. Altogether.,Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.,Yes!
Oh shit. How long did it take?,Did what take?
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.,Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
Oh man, that's the best.,You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.,How?
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.,She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.,You think he's got any herb?
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.,Yep.
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.,Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
That girl you boned last year. Remember?,Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
Man, this guy is really good.,He looks like my uncle.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.,Yeah. She's only 13.
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?,Yeah.
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.,I know what you mean.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.,How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.,Bet.
Yeah. Why you give money.,Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.,So.
So really, it's good luck.,Good luck?
How much you gonna take?,I don't know. How much do you want?
Nah.,Why not? You stink.
Casper, where's Telly.,What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
What?,Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Yeah. Come on.,Hold on.
You know I've been thinking about you lately.,You have?
I thought you had a girlfriend.,Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.,Yeah. I can understand that.
You should come back with me to Steven's house.,Tonight?
Uh huh.,I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.,Nothing?
Who are they?,I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.,No, Fidget, I...
Because your a virgin?,Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
Dance!,What?
Yeah.,Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.,Yeah?
Telly says was up.,I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.,Hell yeah, they don't know.
I hate sucking dick!,Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.,That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
I'm coming.,No. I just gotta go find him.
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.,I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.,Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.,Yeah.
Oh shit.,And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.,Yeah.
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.,You think so?
I hate 'em.,It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
So that's why Casper is how he is.,Oh god. That's horrible.
Mom.,Shh.
What are you guys doing?,Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
So, how many people live here now?,I don't know, eight or nine.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever,To come?
It was... it was.,It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
What man? What is it?,Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?,Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
What do you mean, no?,He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
All you gotta do is look at the map.,His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?,I wouldn't know.
Then let's narrow it down.,Homesearchers.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?,I'm positive.
Yes you are.,Get off me!
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.,Local?
Take it easy.  Both of you.,I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
No shit!,Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
You still having a problem with this?,Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
You alright?,I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.,Find him!  I want to talk to him.
What is it?,It's a voice modulator.
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?,I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
We'll find the evidence.,You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.,I haven't got time for this.
Hello, Peter.,Just a second.  Hello?
And -- what path is that?,We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.,Then call them!
And you want these girls to feel your pain?,Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
What makes you think I was there?,I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
What word did you leave last night?,The police haven't told you?
How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?,You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.,Thanks.
1985.  Hans Korshaud.,He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
What is it?,New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?,You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
It worked out alright, didn't it?,Fuck off!
You must be Erica.,Uh huh.
Who told you that?,Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Don't you have something you want to say to David?,Thanks, David.
You ready?,For what?
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.,I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
Any sign of rape?,Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
Anything?,Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
Well?,Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
What do you think he did?,We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.,Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
He's right, Kathy.,What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?,Ten days ago.
Do you know how she found the apartment?,Through a rental agency.
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?,Only in passing.  To say hello to.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?,To my room and then I went for a walk.
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?,I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out.,We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor.
That's it?,We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.,It doesn't make sense.
Answer the question.,I went out.
Then I'll transpose.,On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
It's a good play, but risky.,You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
You're always in the middle of a match.,I want to be the best I can.
You have something you want to say?,Just thought you might want to talk.
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?,No.
Bainbridge Books.,Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?,No.  I don't.
It seems like such a complicated game.,Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
That's a very personal question.,I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
You.,Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
She could be dead after the game.,She could be dead now.
You sure you don't want to eat something?,I don't think I could.
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.,You sound like my mother.
It wasn't intentional.,Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
Alright.  What about me?,I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
She died in a car accident.,I'm sorry.
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.,It must've been very hard on Erica?
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.,What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.,I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game, is it?,No.
I tried again and got through.,What's wrong?
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.,What?
Hi.,Can I come in?
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.,I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.,You don't understand.
It's over now.,I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.,Well, you're beautiful.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.,If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.,<u>What</u>?
We're almost married.,We're not married <u>yet</u>.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.,Never mind my ears! Go away!
Where is the Fortress?,I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
That's a better one.,Yes.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.,I have no extraordinary powers.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?,In the old books. It's called a glaive.
I am too old to climb down a rope.,You won't have to.
There is nothing.,Reach out farther. Call to her.
You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?,She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.,The Fortress moves?
You choose these?,Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.,The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
Never.,You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!,He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...,The Beast will kill her.
The spiral begins in the west.,Where the spiral begins.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.,No! You cannot know that!
I can. Because I choose it.,I forbid you!
Am I not worth returning to?,Yes.
Help! Help! I'm drowning!,I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.,What business?
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...,I was hoping I might be your friend.
My <u>friend</u>.,I have need of friends.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.,How did you know I had sons?
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.,Hah! You don't know me, boy.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.,You will follow me.
You've eaten nothing.,We must try to get horses.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.,Hand over your dinner.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.,They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.,Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
You're resourceful, my lad.  I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.,Subject to the King, no doubt.
Quell?,I cannot go with you, my friend.
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.,I'd wish for a puppy.
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...,First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.,Would you desert your friends?
Put me down, you lout!,You had better manners as a pig.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?,I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
He is the King.,Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.,Then look!
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.,The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.,I knew.
You were attacked in the forest?,Yes. We lost five.
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.,They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.,It's a hundred leagues from here.
Look.,Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
Who speaks that name!,Ynyr!
It is fifty years since I heard that name.,It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
But you would not stay with me.,Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
She was not as beautiful.,No, she was not as beautiful.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.,Where is he? My son.
Knowledge.,Of what?
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?,No.
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.,Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
It will not help.,Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
I cannot stop the sand.,You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
What's that man's name?,Why do you want to know?
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?,No?
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?,...Not at all.
OK, I'm fine.,Good.
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?,Huh... 500 meters?
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.,What, for example?
Rocket launcher.,Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
The fat man down there, on the bench.,Perfect.
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.,Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.,...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...,There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
Risky business, isn't it?,...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.,I love you so much, Leon.
Poor darling, and then?,Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?,...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?,It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.,...I got lost, Mister.
Don't fear.,I have no fear.
How are you, Miss?,Fine...
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...,I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.,Huh? That's smart!
...Composer.,Huh, that's good!
But... He works for your same employer?,Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...,I know... But I'm a little pressed.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?,No... Dino's.
Salute.,Salute.
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.,I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
Here comes the resume.,I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?,You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.,What?
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.,I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
How long does this... Mania last?,A couple days to a few months if untreated.
Mine.,Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
I know what you're getting at.,You do?
I've seen it before.,You have?
Yes?,The flowers... they're beautiful.
You thought I sent them?,There was no card.
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?,It's just a regular day.
The new store?,Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?,Yes.
Why do you polish that thing all the time?,You're talking to me?
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.,Please tell me.
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --,Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
Why?,Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
Doubts?  About what?,About my love for her.
Shit!  He jumped!,Jumped where?
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.,Is that right?
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.,You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.,That's me.
Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand?,What was that?
What happened?,Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
Are you firing me?,No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim.
When are you leaving?,Tomorrow.
I'm walking there Kris.,Walking where?
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.,I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back.
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?,I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.,Why know?
Are they standing?,Saluting.
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.,I do.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?,Don't do this.
... My father.,Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?,Yes.
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.,Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.,How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.,Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
You OK?,Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Yes.,Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.,What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
Giving you money makes me want to come.,Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
I am planning to go out and do some work.,When?
What was that all about?,Can we just forget it?
I don't understand any of that.,Can we just ignore it?
Thank you, Sera.,Do you want me not to go tonight?
Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.,They wouldn't know.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?,I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
You have been lonely?,I've been all right.
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.,Yuri... are you...
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.,Get up.
That's just it -- it would ruin me!,How?
And when you came downstairs, what happened?,I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?,No, she'd stashed it by then.
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.,Yes. I was washing my hair.
How many, would you say?,Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
Why the hell not?,I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
Good work today, Ms. Woods.,Thank you!
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.,Thank you.
I do. I'm not allowing it.,But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
What did you see when you entered the house?,I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?,Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.,Too bad you and I are the only ones.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.,You're kidding!
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.,Really?
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.,So?
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.,How do you figure?
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?,No, she can't move for an hour.
How can you still believe she's innocent?,You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
And you know this for a fact?,Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
What the hell is that for?,The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
He's gay! Enrique is gay!,What?!
Hey --,I'm quitting.
Oh, he is so over on this campus.,I just don't understand what went wrong --
How could this happen?,I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?,Absolutely!
What?,I got bangs!
Yes? Ms. Woods?,I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?,She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
Amazing how?,She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
You don't really believe she's innocent?,Of course, I do!
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.,There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --,You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.,You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.,I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
So -- uh -- how was your first class?,Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
I didn't mean --,Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
Thanks for the backup.,How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.,Really?
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?,Yes.
She's naked.,I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
Is it a Kappa?,It's not a Theta --
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?,Cunnilingus?
You go?  Not watch fun?,I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Fire moat... why do that?,Purely a precaution...
What?,Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
My generosity is not so large as that.,What do you want with me?
And you... are you not also afraid?,I am afraid of nothing.
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...,Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?,Kill me... I want... so nice...
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.,And then?
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...,Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
Might we watch, too?,Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...,And, now?
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.,I didn't know... I --
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?,Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.,Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?,I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.,Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.,Who might these friends be?
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?,Faerie ring?
Enough!,And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
It's bluebells!,What!
You be our guest, Jack.,I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.,Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
But... but, why?,Big question that, lad.  Why what?
Don't you know?,If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
Are we here?,Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.,And if she thinks me a liar?
The princess is dead.,Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.,Have we turned grave-robber, then?
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.,Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
Shhhh!,Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.,Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?,A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
Track the demon to his lair.,Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.,Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.,That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods.
Nice piece of work.,Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.,Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
Certainly understandable.,Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
I should hope not!,Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
Is she... dead?,No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
Give in to despair and all is lost.,It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.,Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
Why not mine the damned walls?,We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?,Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.,... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.,I don't... understand.
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...,In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.,What weapon?
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --,I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?,She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.,That's it then... the ring!
How're these?,They'll do nicely.
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.,Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
You promised!,Never.
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.,Sport, indeed.
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?,Unicorn?
A promise is a sacred oath.,All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.,Stop complaining.
A gentleman would offer water.,Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.,I'll go search for it.
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!,I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
They tricked you.,My own father...
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.,Oh, la...
What have I done?,Only what's right...
No!  I won't let it happen...,You've freed me, Jack...
Sunlight?,That's why he goes masked during the day...
I can't see a thing.,Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
Step lively now!,His feet shall never cross my lips.
What's this now?,I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?,They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.,Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
Exceeding fair.,As fair as me?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.,She's dead!
I don't believe you.,Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
This is not the time for squabbling.,Sorry.
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!,Heading north still?
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?,His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.,No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
How came you by this blade?,I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
Uhm... fine work.,Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
Oh.,I would have anyway.
So put your plans of my room in the trash.,I don't think Dad wants you home.
I couldn't get it to go down.,And why was the alarm on?
Alyssa.,Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?,He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
It's not what I was expecting.,What did you think it would be?
I might not stay, anyway.,I'll get your back.
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.,I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
We're not gonna do anything.,Why are you so stupid?
Why are you so uptight?,I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
What's the point of this?,Does everything have to have a point?
Are you guys' friends?,We've known each other since grade school.
I wouldn't want you as a friend.,George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.,He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
Oh, yes.,And if I enclosed it?
I'm good, thanks.,What are you on?
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.,I'm not.
Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.,I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.,I hate this job.
Well, I feel better about this now.,Good.  I was hoping for that.
Sam?,Uh huh.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.,Not a shower.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.,Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
Is Alyssa here?,It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
I did warn you.,My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.,I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?,No I'm not!
I'm not going!,I'll get your bag.
What are you doing?!,I warned you yesterday.
I don't know.,I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
No one would blame me if I left!,I'd blame you.  I want you here.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?,I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
I don't beg.,And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
I can promise you complete privacy.,You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
Where are you going?,I don't know.
When are you going to be back?,I don't know.
I'll have to pay him back.,I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
Hi, Alyssa.,Hi, Mom.
That's not true.,See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
I know parts of who you are.,What do you know about me?
If I asked you to stop, would you?,I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Why wouldn't she leave?,I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
I would have killed him.,Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.,You lied to me!
No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?,Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
Good for you.,I haven't been touched in years.
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.,Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.,Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
Because Dad left?,She's a little sad, is all.
What?,I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.,You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
Four days.  I left to think.,What did you do with your dog?
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.,How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.,He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
Hey, hey!,I'm married.
Last time you were gone for a week!,Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
I did say he could go.,Let's go.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.,Which?
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?,Sam's favorite.
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.,What have you been before today?
I've been wrong a lot in my life.,Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.,I smiled at him.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?,Going on?
Is your back still killing you?,I didn't think you'd come today.
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?',What did he say?
Nothing.,You got any weed?
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.,I could use the money.
Then you tell me, what just happened?,The payoff.
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.,What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
That's the problem.,Please don't leave me.
I hardly recognize you with a beard.,That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.,Are you wearing eye shadow?
Hey.,Hey.
I've missed you guys.,Why?
The door was open.,I don't know what I'm doing.
You could keep it and rent it out?,This is what he wants.
She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.,Is Mae Rose okay?
It's 1945. It's a different world now.,Not for me, it ain't.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.,Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.,I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.,But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
Sharp.,I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.,Yes, boss.
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.,It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.,Goodnight, Claude.
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!,Here!
Comfortable?,As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?,I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.,He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
I've never seen you in here before.,That's because I've never been here before.
Don't I know you?,I don't think so.
What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?,I don't see where that's any of your business.
What are they gonna do to us?,You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
What?,Nothing.
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.,Why didn't you take it?
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.,Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
Alright. You want some pie?,Yeah, I want some pie.
So?,He does it all by himself.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.,What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
What I know about boats is they take you to freedom. Come on, man. I think we can do this.,Why are you always talking about we? There is no we. There is a me, there is a you. But there is no we between us.
What's up, Ray?,Claude.
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --,Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
Does that mean I'm in?,I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
Don't mention it.,Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.,How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.,Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.,Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.,After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
Damn, it was getting hot in there.,What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.,You ain't getting out of that trunk.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.,We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.,Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right.,'Course I was right. About what?
It's too late for plans.,Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
I can't eat this.,Why the hell not?
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?,Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
You ever done time before?,You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.,My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
Where am I at, man?,C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
Hey, the dude's holdin'.,Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?,No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.,Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?,He must still be in there.
Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.,You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.,You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
Apparently, your sister died.,Jenny?
Who?,Satchmo.
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.,Greenville, that the nearest town?
What's your name?,Me? Willie Long.
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?,That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Blacks welcome there?,Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.,But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?,Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.,Understood.
ADRIAN!,You shouldn't have come here.
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.,Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
I knew it. He's finally retiring.,I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.,And he's dead serious.
That's what I thought!,Could you concentrate for five seconds?
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?,What do you think about... Earth?
We could create our own hell there.,You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
"Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.,Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
Hello, Cassius.,All right. Let me out.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.,You mother...
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?,Noon...
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?,Sure, why not?
Try an angel.,An angel?
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi.",Well tell her I said "hi" back.
How did you see me?,We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.,I can't screw.  I can't screw.
Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.,It's not me, moron.
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.,The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?,Everything's fine, pop.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.,Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.,What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
So go get 'em, Jimmy!,I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!,You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.,'Bout time...
There's our man.,Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
What's with that guy?,Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.,Should we wake him up?
You sure you're down with this?,Little nervous. Wanna puke.
Looking for the chief.,We know where to find Nicky.
Schnapps...,Peppermint... alright.
This don't look good.,Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
Please. You got to.,All right...
You got the wrong window again, man.,Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
You think I'm a tourist?,I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.,Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.,School?
No.,What are you doing?
Can we go fly over Central Park?,Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?,From my dad's side of the family.
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?,Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.,Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
I'm a Sandman!,I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!,No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
Answer the question!,Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
How do you want us?,Up there.
All right. Now you keep your bargain.,Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
How did they get in here?,Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?,Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.,Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one.",Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.,Only a few? You're just not trying.
That was a great shot you made.,Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.,Did you?
Of course.,Anybody we know?
Why did you do that??!!,I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.,Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
Later.,No.
What Quad do you live in?,K.
Of course.,Then it's still no.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?,You know.
About running, dying what?,Both... running's what I'm interested in.
Where did you get that?,A Runner gave it to me.
And then you killed him, right?,I let him go... believe me.
I don't..,Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.,You're not going, are you?
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.,I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast,Muscle? I don't know that one.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...,That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.,He's good, isn't he?
Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...,They won't believe us.
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,,We'll convince them.
I hate outside! I hate it!,We'll be all right...  We will...
Don't!,Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --,You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?,Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?,Yes...
Are you sure?,Mother and Father said so... you know?
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?,No.
What belongs to the people?,All this. All of it.
Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...,We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.,A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
What kind of place is this?,Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
Are there any other humans?,Gracious... no.
Are you ready to put him in?,Not yet.
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?,More... many more.
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?,I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
That's better than gold when it's cold.,Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.,Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.,You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
Good... You up for a drive?,Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
Listen.,You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
What's happenin'?,They're comin' with us.
You okay, man?,What?
Why not?,It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
What a fuckin' job.,His or ours?
I was here yesterday.,Yeah, I remember.
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.,Over there.
Hello.,It's me...
Sure.,I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
Have you partied with him?,I used to.
In pornos?,No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.,Okay.
Are you my man?,Yes.
You all right?,We killed him.
You killed him.,Alice?
Alice...,We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
Where's the bathroom?,Up the stairs - down the hall.
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.,Alice?
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?,He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
Better.,Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.,Do ya good.
You don't look so good.,I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.,But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
His condition? What do you mean?,His physical condition.
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.,Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
One of the guards must have leaked it.,What's the word on the street?
That's not Fred Madison?,No, sir, it's not.
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?,Pete, what happened to you?
Who is it?,He won't give his name.
I won't ever tailgate.,DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
Something wrong?,My... My head.
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.,No, no. I want to go in.
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.,What do you mean? You're where right now?
At your house.,That's absurd.
Who's it from?,I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
Does it say anything on the tape?,No, nothing.
Same one you were reading the other night?,What night?
I had a dream about you last night...,Yeah?
We've got to call the police.,All right.
We will.,Thanks, guys.
I thought you were getting me a drink?,Just a minute.
What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?,No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.,Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
At sixty?,Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.,It'll be ready.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?,At your house. Don't you remember?
You want some company?,Sure.
You still care about me?,Sure. Sure I do.
No... I told you.,It was weird...
Sheila?!,No... I really don't want to talk about it.
I was?,Yeah.
All of it?,Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.,Let me have it.  "Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."
What about those men we met this morning?,Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
Two years!?,Yes.
Fossils, huh?,I'm a paleontologist.
A what?,A paleontologist.
I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.,Well, what do you know about that!
I say, good morning, Lovey.,Good morning
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.,I see.
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?,Why, of course. Yes.
Is it?,It certainly is.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.,Oh, really?
Yes.,Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.,Now you're irritating and absurd!
He might have lost his way.,Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!,All right, all right. Keep quiet.
Where are they? Do you see them?,Yes!
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.,All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
No kidding?,Yes.
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!,colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.,Just call me Barney.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!,And be poisoned out here in the open?
then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!,I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
They were in a quandary, and,Come on, Lovey.
What are we going to do?,Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?,I'll say.
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.,Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
Huh?,Gold. You were going to
I say, will you have a cigarette?,No.
If you want me to!,Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
You mean you don't want to go?,Well - I'm
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.,Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including  the excess of virtue itself.,That's intelligent.
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.,That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
Well, it must have taken,Centuries.
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?,That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.,Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?,The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Yes. I'm afraid it does.,Shall we have another?
Charming, isn't she?,Yes, charming.
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.,The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation.",Now, what would you like to do?
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.,I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.,Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!,Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?,Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!,Father Perrault is dead.
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!,Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!,Hey!
It's astonishing - and incredible, but,What is it, my son?
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago  you're still alive, Father Perrault!,Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.,Right, Bob.
George, what are you going to do?,I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
He's dead.,Dead?
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.,You talk as though you intend on staying.
Did I say "if"?,That's what you said.
George, what do you think you're doing?,Let me go, Bob!
What about the porters?,Porters?
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.,I don't see that there's anything to say.
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.,So you think I'm mad?
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.,I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.,What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
You say the porters are waiting for us?,Yes.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.,As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.,Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?,That was easy. I read your books.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.,Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
Ouch!,You see, it's not a dream.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?,Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
You'll wait till you rot!,Yes.  Barney!
EXCUSE ME,Please don't go.
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?,It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?,It's not even a fucking door.
It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.,And if I say yes?
They don't?,They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.,We're the government, Cowan.
Only the damn guy won't know it.,What happens if I say no?
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.,Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.,Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.,Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.,Kay...
Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.,What?
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?,So what's the problem?
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.,It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
I know, but we're on a college campus...,This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.,Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
What?,Something seem unusual to you about that?
Something's wrong here.,Gee.  You really think?
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--,That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
What are you doing?,Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
Since how long?,Since as long as we've been keeping records...
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.,For how long?
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!,Kay!?
You were saying?,Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.,You know, there's something we never really thought of...
So... how'd you hear about this?,Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
Right, right-- I like that stuff.,With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.,But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
When?,It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?,Noon exactly.
They're gone.,Dee?  What are you doing here?
Yeah?  What's up?,I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
What?,They're inside.
Agatha --,Can you see the balloon man?
Drop some money.,Forget that guy --
He's here.,Anderton, leave.
I can't.  I have to know.,Please --
And replace them with new ones.,I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
Why?,Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
Victim's a white female.,This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
You the only sentry?,I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.,Lara --
Lara called me.,What?
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.,Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.,All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --,John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...,Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.,Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
The mall?,Georgetown.
You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.,Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
Red Ball?,Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.,That was easy.
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?,Yes, it is.
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.,You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
To them.,Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
But you call this room the "temple".,Just a nickname.
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.,What does he think of your chosen line of work?
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?,Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...,Oh... Hi, John.
Okay... now let me time you.,Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
What the hell.,I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
I forgive you...,The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
Sean, wait...,Hold your breath, Dad...
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.,Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --,NO!
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.,Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.,I'm... not... a... killer.
Just what is it you think I can do for you?,You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
You don't seem all that proud.,I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
What?,Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
You said they're destroyed.,I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
Where?,Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
-- and then walk out.,Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...,Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
Oh, God, what did you do?,Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
Who?,Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her.",We know why John was tagged.
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?,Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
The guy from USA Today is here.,Tell him not now.
He just wanted a few minutes before --,Not.  Now.
Sir, the press conference is starting.,I'll be right there.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.,The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?,None of your damn business.
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.,Where are you?
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?,Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.,How?
Precog Deja Vu...,We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
He's trying to prove his innocence.,He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
John Anderton was my friend!,You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...,How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --,I know who you are.
That was our apartment.,Have you been there recently?
It was nobody's fault.,But John was with him at the pool?
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.,It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
Nice to meet you, Wally.,Shhh!  They're sleeping.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.,But there's still the other two.
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.,You're Bobby, right?
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.,Snifter are for warm drinks --
I can take you down there.,Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
Are you sure?,Yeah. Take it.
Thank you very much, sir.,So?
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.,Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
Is he cute?,He's okay.
I know.,But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
Oh no. What is it this time.,We used to take baths together.
Ricky's not wearing one.,Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?,Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.,I love you. Come home.
Honey?,Where were you?
No. What kind of bachelor party?,The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.,I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.,They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
Well, that's not gonna happen.,Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!,Shhh. He'll hear you.
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?,I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
He making the drop?,Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
What's that?,A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
Where is this happening?,We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?,No.
That it?,That's it.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?,Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.,They were out of line --
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.,I'll work it off.
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.,So, that's it. I'm out?
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.,I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.,I know.
I got a way we make everybody happy.,Yeah.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.,He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
Yeah. Sure.,How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
Yes.,What is it?
There won't be a next thing.,Take a few days --
A bad heart.,I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
Nah.,Traveling light. I like that.
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?,Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
I can wait around if you want.,No. That's cool, man.
Spa?,Yeah.
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?,Ricky's taken care of.
We're with Ruiz.,Ruiz isn't here.
Sorry, man, but...,Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
Any time, bro.,Thanks.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?,Yeah. I know the number.
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.,I know the number.
I'll page you with the number.,Bye.
Come on, man. Not with the owners here.,Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
He implied it.,You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.,What are we delivering?
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.,I'm not taking her to a bar.
Right here's fine.,Is that the woman from..?
Holy shit. Can you believe this?,Pretty nice.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.,I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.,Maybe we should call for a cab.
C'mon, man...,Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.,Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?,Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
What are you doing?,What are you doing?
They didn't say an address?,I told you what they said.
Nothing else.,Nothing.
This is bullshit, man.,What the fuck do you...
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.,Missing what? He didn't say shit.
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?,What did I 'get?'
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.,You got that right.
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.,We're getting whacked.
What are you doing.,I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
Let's do it.,I'm your soldier.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.,I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
We need guns.,We don't need guns.
Float me a hundred bucks.,Why?
Eighty five.,What happened to the fifteen hundred?
I'm sorry...,This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
It's gonna be fine.,No more, man.
Three and a half hours?,I don't want to take any more chances.
Dude, we were practically made...,I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
Hey, boys.,Tom. How's it going?
You want to come splash around.,I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
You look good, man.,Cool. See you later.
How much is what?,The videos.
Yes?,Drinks are free, right?
Don't drag my ass into this --,He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.,Why? What I say bad?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?',What? Why am I bad?
I'm half Irish.,I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
No shit?,Does anyone want another?
Coke?,I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Come, now. You just got here.,That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...,Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
A lot of Persians?,Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
What about my keys?,You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
Don't worry. I get it.,So tell me how it is.
We're square.,Yes, sir.
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.,Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
Who's gonna outfit us?,Outfit? What's he talking about?
Yeah.,What?
When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?,That's none of your fucking business.
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?,So, you must be the Red Dragon.
Edinburgh.,And where might that be?
Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.,He had it coming.
Where can I get a hold of you?,YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
When?,Just now.
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?,Let 'em come. I'm ready.
You're a damn liar.,You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?,You know it.
I'll give you back the 600.,I don't want your money.
And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.,That's what it is. Walk on out.
Let Billie finish.,Now.
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.,I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.,Yeah.
Man live by his rep.,That's a fact. What you do, boy?
The dirty yellow rat bastard.,Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
Man, what do you want?,You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?,That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
What did you give it to me for then?,'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
Why? Why does everybody conk?,Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
Leggo. I got to wash it out.,Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.,Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
Don't con me.,What do you do with your time?
What? Everybody knows God is White.,But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
What for?,Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
I can't make out that shit.,Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
Where am I gonna start?,Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.,Read it and keep on reading.
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.,Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
I can't.,For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
I don't know what to say to Allah.,Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
Is the program ready?,No, Brother Minister.
Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.,Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.,Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
Just an idle question.,If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.,What do you think?
Why are you looking at me like that?,Because you're in trouble.
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.,I'm not made of glass.
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children...",There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.,Betty it's me. It's me.
Dear heart, where are you?,At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.,I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
Why don't you just ask your question?,You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.,Just what is your question?
Let him finish.,Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
If you want to tell me.,Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.,Allah Akbar.
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.,I say a lot of things.
'Lo. I've got to freshen up.,Now you come back.
I mean it's late, baby.,I know where you're going.
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --,Murder.
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?,Please make way, please --
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.,What mission?
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.,What does Sidney say?
I'm with you, Brother Minister.,No. You'll be marked for death.
Sweetie, they're almost ready.,You hear me, girl?
You the man.,You better believe it.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.,Shorty, this is Laura.
That's a fine chick.,Fine as May wine.
Bang, bang. You're dead.,Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.,Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.,Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --,Might be all right.
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?,Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.,You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
Only a pig could do a thing like that.,Watch your tongue, boy.
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.,He told you that?
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.,This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.,It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.],[What is his name?]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.],[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[Do you know who I am?],[Who are you?]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!],[Who ordered it?]
[Yeah.  Yes.],[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[The girl's. Pinta's.],[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[Please, don't...],[It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.],[And?]
[Maybe your men stole from you.],[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.],[That's what everybody keeps saying.]
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?,Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
But don't you stay in El Paso?,Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
You been working?,Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.,You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.,Pinta...
Stomach's gone. But... okay.,I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?,If they like me.
Where are you from, Creasy?,The United States.
No.,Why not?
And don't start crying.,I'm not crying.
No.,How do you think he got out?
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?,White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
Do you always sleep with him?,I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
Why do you ask?,It was in a book at school. Concubine.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?,No, that was in Columbia.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?,Yes.
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.,There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
What's so important in Los Angeles?,Your father has business.
Could I ask you a question?,Could I stop you?
You don't drink like you used to.,That's not a question.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?,Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
You think too much?,Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.,You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.,Dyslexic?
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.,You got that right.
The world of our children. How dare they?,It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.,I'm fine.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.,The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
I don't believe you.,I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
You're lying. I don't believe you.,Then don't come.
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.,And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
[You have the money.],[Yes.]
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.],[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
Good news. You're going back to school.,When?
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.,We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.,You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
She likes him.,Hmm?
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.,That's ridiculous.
[I know this. Your point?],[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?],[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
He's not a cop killer.,I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.,Two tourists who never went home.
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.,I can take care of myself.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...,All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.,Oh, yeah.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?,I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.,What makes you say that?
Waddaya gonna do now?,I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
You want me to ride down with you?,What for?
Are you kidding?,Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.,I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?,I feel fine.
Oh.,Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
Who?,Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
It pains that they should do this.,I know it pains.
Marty.,Your son Marty?
Yeah.,Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.,This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.,Actually, I don't make friends easily.
This is the kitchen.,Yes, I know.
No...,Please...
No...,Please...
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?,Nothing.
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.,I'd like that very much.
You got an elevator in this house?,We just live one flight up.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.,It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?,Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!,I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.,That's the one.
...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy.",Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
Sure. This girl said...,What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...,I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
Hello, Ma.,Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
Oh, we got plenny-a room here.,Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?,Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?,Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...,I heard you, Ma.
I said, is she Italian girl?,I don't know. I don't think so.
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.,Well, let's not get inna fight about it, Ma.
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.,Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
Hello, Ralph.,Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.
I'm with a girl, Ralph.,Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?,That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.,Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...,Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?,Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.,Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
He coming home right now.,So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister...",So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
Sure.,Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?,I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...,Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
Tommy...,I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
Wadda you so sore about?,Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!,She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.,Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski  Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
Stop him! Stop that man!,Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?,Home.
Y'all mind the store.,Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
You  must  open  me  up  again?,No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
Us. Lead us not into...,...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?,C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.,That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.,He can't take much more time on the table.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.,This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.,Yeah, if I can.
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!,When?
Wait a second...,I can't... couldn't.
I was just asking...,Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.,A football game?
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.,But what about Major Houlihan?
I think I heard about that.,Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...,I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?,Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.,No, no, that one.
Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.,And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
Is he out?,Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
For you, Trapper.,Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.,What do we do?
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?,Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
All of them?,That's right. We work well together.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.',It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.,Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
The bastards outconned us.,I think we could still have a chance.
What's the matter?,We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
See you.,It's possible
How did you get called that?,'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
Very happily married.,Same here.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.,Ayuh.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?,It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.,I didn't mean with me.
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.,You think he won't.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.,I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.,Why would he do that?
What's the story?,Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.,You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.,You can cut the bow.
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.,Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
What's wrong with you?,I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.,I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...,One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
Sir?,Oh, get out of here!
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.,The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?,I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
How is he?,Nice.
Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he?,Nice.
Oh. Yeah.,You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Hello, John.,Hello.
Uh-huh . . .,Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.,Me?
Can I help you pack?,No, thank you.
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?,I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.,Look, Johnwhat we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?,Yes, sir.
Thank you very much for everything.,And, Miss MitchellI think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Hello?,John! I'm so glad to see you. II was terribly worried.
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!,All set, Ann?
That's good.,No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Oh.,Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.,Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?,Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.,You bet I will, Ma.
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.,There is no letter.
You made it up.,Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doeand he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!,A deal?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?,Well, you're catching on.
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.,Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!,That's all, Ned. Thank you.
Okay, sister, you get your job back.,Plus a bonus.
All right, boys, here he is.,No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like thateating a sandwichand with a beard!
Well, maybe you're right.,We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!,That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
Where's Connell?,He's watching the other door.
Ann! Say, why didn't yuh,Beany!
What do they want?,They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.,Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!,. . . Tubby?
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy,Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
Ba-ll!,I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!,There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.,Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
A what?,A gag. A gag!
Aw, Long John . . . I tell youit's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! ,Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!,The elevators are still runnin'.
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.,Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
I trust him.,Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
Listen, palthis fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11],Yeah. It certainly is.
I want it as soon as possible.,Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?,I think maybe you'd better. And ConnellI'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!,No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
No, I didn't write it, but,Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?,Uh-huh.
Have you got the speech I gave you?,Yeah.
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!,What?

And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.,Roper, we're into it...
You don't have to come here.,Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.,Is that all?
For now that's all.,You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
You can't kill me like this.,What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
Satisfied?,Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
It's all there.,Spread it out.
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?,Yeah.

How long you been coming here?,About six years. My partner took me.
He's got the girl.,Damnit!
How many have you lost?,I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.,So what do you want to do?
McCall, you all right?,I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Is the hostage injured?,Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.,You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?,I ain't interested in your life story.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.,And why the fuck would you do that for me?
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?,I'm not drunk. Yet.
I wanted to get this out of the way.,You got a bet on the game tonight?
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.,Yeah that's it.
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.,Use your imagination.
Scottie?,Hmm?
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...,Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
You crazy? With all those people around?,Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
Stay up there, Girl...,Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.,Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.,Okay, I think I could swing that.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.,Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
What do we got?,32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
What have you promised them?,Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
This is Halden.,Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
There are two million people in there with you.,Yes.
It's okay.,Okay...
She said I have a son...,No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do.,One would assume so.

You sure he's going to come?,It's his nature.
But what if he doesn't --,-- He will.
Take care.,Take care?  Where the hell are you going --

The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.,Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?,A stellar idea, Skull.
And how do we do that?,By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
... A falcon?,Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
And how do we release the power?,The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!,GO IVAN!!
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!,So they've been destroyed?

But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.,When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.,Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.,Charlie Luciano.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.,Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
And now you have everything.,No. Not everything.
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.,Could we step outside?
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.,An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
We could lose the deal!,If we have to.
Shane was a friend of yours?,He was around...
Bastard didn't even show.,He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?,Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
The deal's too good, Frankie,What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.,We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
What's the matter?,I must be going.
Luciano.,I was calling yesterday.
You got something to hide?,It's too late.
Would it be painful for you?,It always is.
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.,So what is the problem?
I'll handle the Boss.,So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
Your honeymoon, Meyer?,Might as well put the time to use.
Come off it, Bugs.,Come off it, Bugs.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.,Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
I'm glad ya come.,What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.,He's trying to make it.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.,So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
Where we headed?,Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!,Didn't know you felt that way.
Not stupid. Fat.,Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.,Come on, Charlie. We got business.
Don Maranzano. Welcome.,I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.,I must know more of you, my son.
And how many soldiers do you have?,I've got friends.
We must be friends, Charlie.,Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
The terms will be mine.,The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.,You disrespect our tradition.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.,Masseria's been after me too.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.,Okay. I'm listening.
What's it worth to ya, Boss?,Anything!
Anything ain't a very hard number.,One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me.,Just wanted ta say hello.
Who did this?,Stu. That was right about the time we met.
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.,Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
Olive or eyeball?,Olive. - Where exactly am I?
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.,<u>Why</u>??
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.,I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.,I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -,Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.,Why?
Oh my God...you're proposing?,My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.,A piata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...,Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...,Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?,YOU SET ME UP!!
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!,But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.,Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!,Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...,That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
I might wake up.,<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.,I'd better go report this...
How was it? I don't recall.,It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?,I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -,Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!,THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
I'm reportin' this to my union!!,<u>What</u> union?
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??,Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resum. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?,Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. - DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!,<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
Stu...LOOK!,What?
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?,We like to think so, yeah.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.,What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
... What are they all doing there?,That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
Well, they were right out in plain view.,Behind the books.
But I was dusting.,I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.,Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
What's wrong?,Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
Mom, I need to talk to you.,If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?,Oh, I hope so, dear.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.,Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!,Goodbye, sweetheart.
Really?,Oh, it was such a big scandal.
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--,Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.,Thanks very much, sonny--
It was?,Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?,I did not--
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?,I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.,Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?,Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?,Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
Oh--that again. Yeah.,I would cherish you--and stay sober.
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.,I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.,And to Don Quixote!
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--,Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
Okay. You don't mind?,I'll cherish ya.
Yeah--that's right. Diz--,What?
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--,What?
Well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.,Huh?
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--,Why me?
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--,Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
What!,Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--,Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--,This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing.,Nonsense.
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?,Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
He's batty!,Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!,Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
*You won't?*,I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
What!,Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--,Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.,I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?,Is *what* getting me down?
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!,Uh--could--could I help--?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--,When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--,Look! There it is!
Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.,Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot.
Will the Senator yield?,For a question!
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.,His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
I will, sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--,Nonsense, Jeff.
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--,That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--,Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
Yield *how*, sir?,Will he yield for a question?
Mr. President--,He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.,The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
Yes, sir, you bet I would.,Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
Oh, now--,Jefferson--
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!,Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--,What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--,Most natural thing in the world!
Whose statue is that?,I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?,Convene?
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--,With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?,No. What had you better--?
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!,Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
Committee.,Why?
You mean--here?,Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.,I also answer to whistles.
I've got more. You better tell me.,You win. It's--Clarissa.
Well--no. I didn't. Why?,Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--,Not another bill?
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! ,Do you want to dictate them?
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.,Thanks a lot.
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!,Don't mention it--
What are you going to do?,I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!,Oh--Saunders--
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?,Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.,Wonderful!
Oh--you are!,Then you *did* say it.
I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?,Splendid.
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.,You're not going to take your *suit* off!
I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--,The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?,Yes, sir--
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.,Ring the call to quorum.
Well, now--I wouldn't know about that. Mr. President--what happens to me in the morning--I mean about my having this floor to go on babbling?,If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair.
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.,Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.,A Bill! Not *him*!
Chick--,I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?,Let's get away from here. 
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.,Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?,Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.,No?
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.,Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
Nice *compliment*!,I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--,You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
What do you want, Senator?,Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.,Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.,Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.,Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
What do you think?,Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?,Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!,No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.,I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
Father--oh.,Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?,Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.,Page boys!
That's going to be fun.,Some people like it.
Most every day.,Sometimes twice.
They think he's pixilated.,Oh yes, pixilated.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.,Yes, you own it.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.,Uh-huh.
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?,No!
Oh, thank you!,Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.,Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.,What did they say?
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.,Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?,No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
Yes, if it isn't too late.,I'll get my hat.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.,No, I don't mind.
Would you like to read it? It's to you.,Yes, of course.
People have been crucified before.,Why? Why do we have to do it?
Huh?,No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
With pay!,Uh-huh.
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That",Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he,Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.,Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.,Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Ow! My foot's asleep!,Come on - let's go!
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.,But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
Who? Miss Dawson?,Yes, sir.
Gold, eh?,Yes, sir.
He's not home, I tell you!,I wanna see that guy!
Thank heaven.,Better wire him right away, John.
Come on, John. What happened?,The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
Relatives of old man Semple.,They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
Newspaperman?,Wants to know who the heir is.
That's pretty.,Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
Where?,Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.,Okay.
How do you do.,How do you do.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?,Yes.
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?,Who - me? No.
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.,Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?,Is Mr. Deeds in?
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?,Nah.
Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?,Uh-huh.
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.,Oh, they insisted on following me.
Sometimes it's the only solution.,Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.,Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
Why, it's an artistic institution,We own an opera house, don't we?
We provide opera.,But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.,Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
Why not?,Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?,Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?,Ja.
Let him alone.,Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.,That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?,You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.,And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.,Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?,Well, I play the tuba.
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?,Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
Brookfield just came in.,Oh, the poet? Where?
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!,Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?,Binge?
Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?,I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
Where is your farm?,South Dakota north.
What do you think you're doing?,Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Yes, sir.,What's that?
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.,You have no pants, sir.
That's what the two policemen said, sir.,What two policemen?
But she's on the telephone,Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written.",Uh-huh. What are they?
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.,One hundred books?
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --,Take your time.
You can go out there if you like...,"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?,No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?,Were you supposed to have a session?
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.,I'm fine.
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...,...And I from Phyllis.
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.,Are we?
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...,What kind of doubts?
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.,As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
Why not?,Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --,Mr. Follett.
Why? I'm paying for this.,Not for this. Not me, you're not.
I was... never satisfied.,Now we're back on track.
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...,My pleasure.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well.",I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.,What do you do?
...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?,Yes, your honor.
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.,I'm sorry, your honor.
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...,Oh?
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...,What?
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?,I'd better get in there.
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.,Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
It was Henry Follett.,Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.,Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
...so rich?,...so accomplished.
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --,-- Go on!
-- you crazy? You can't do this!,Sure I can, Lionel.
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!,And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.,Thanks for your help, Lionel.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.,That would explain it.
What's wrong with her?,Is she a friend of yours?
Hiya, Doc.,Martin.
Just who is here, can you tell me?,Could I see Sofie, please?
What can you tell me about this?,Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
When did you start to feel this way?,About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.,Hmm.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.,Maybe you'll catch it.
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.,You've got a funny idea of funny.
I've offended you!,No.
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.,Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
I can give myself a headache instantly.,Is that like a party trick?
It doesn't matter. Go on.,Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...,Yes.
That was really bad, wasn't it?,Disgusting.
Is that when you split up?,No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
So whose route is this?,Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?,I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
My brother said you were about to fire me.,That's one way to put it.
Is it something you've heard about me?,No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.,Okay...
I guess you saw the show...?,Which show was that?
Sofie...,Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
We're only talking about six weeks.,Will you be here?
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?,Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?,It's my bit for the community.
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...,Do you think that's what he wants?
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.,No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
Would you like another beer?,Nah... scotch.
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.,Is that the question?
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.,Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
What?,This --
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.,Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --,-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Slash what?,Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
How's it coming?,You don't think I'm insane?
Who else knows?,Just you.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.,Holy shit!
I know it starts with a birth certificate...,All new people start with that...
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!,I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.
I've never brought anyone down here before.,I'm honored.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?,There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.,Really?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.,What'd I do?
I'm here for you, Doc.,Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?,Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
You know where he's taking her?,Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
I never killed a priest before.,They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!,None of the above, thank you.
You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell.,So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.,Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.,Perhaps.
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.,What is he doing here?
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?,To have stopped this creature? Yes!
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.,No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.,Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!,For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!,Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
You bastards!,What did you do to him!?
And what is he in prison for?,I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
So who's the broad?,Broad?!
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?,Want to know?
We're almost there.,Are you sure?
For what?,We're about to be shown the way.
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.,You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?,Very slowly.
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.,That bad huh?
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.,Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
I think you were jealous,Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
Got guts, lady.,Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
Have you no respect for the dead?,Right now, I only wish to join them.
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?,He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!,Yes,... I see.
She's my sister, actually.,Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
Hey,... don't I know you?,Um, well, you see...
Who's here!?,The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
We gotta get her back.,I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!,You have got to be joking?
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?,Of course.
And what's that?,That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?,Fantasizing... about you.
Who are you?,I'm the Bowler.
Sounds good to me.,Let's do it.
But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --,Or even what it looks like.
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.,Half a Dirty Dozen!
Eat your mustard.,It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
Are you with me... or against me?,Against.
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.,You're dead.
Then why are you here?,Curiosity.
What?,I saw him walk you home.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.,Me, too.
At the Frankenstein Center.,Are you nuts? Get out of there!
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.,What?
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?,I just know.
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.,Good or evil, what's the difference?
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!,The wise snake coils before he strikes.
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. ,He is in love. His anger is gone.
And it would be the right thing to do.,Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
You sure that's how you spell it?,Yeah.
There's just not enough of us.,But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
There's a big difference.,I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
I'll drive.,Not a chance!
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!,There's a vague similarity.
Let's go.,Wait!... Look!
Agents?,Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
Roy --,Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?,Yes.
Wow.,And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!,But... the silverware?
This is bad.,Who are they?
We may be getting in over our heads here.,This looks like a job for Superman --
And there's the Sphinx.,The who?
And a social life.,Yeah, but how do we get to them?
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.,And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.,But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.,General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.,You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.,Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.,Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?,No, thank you.
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.,What do you have in mind?
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.,Are you serious?
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.,Any cannon?
There are none here.,Where are they?
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.,Fair enough.
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.,Unhappily, it is true, sire.
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?,The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.,I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.,Yes, sire?
Was the trip normal in every respect?,Yes, sir.
Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.,Thank you, sir.
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.,Oh -- where do you come from?
Why are you carrying the dog?,His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
When did it start?,The first reports came in at about ten.
How did it spread so quickly?,It is the work of incendiaries.
Impossible, I don't believe it.,We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.,What is that?
Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.,Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
That is correct.,This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.,My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
Shall we move closer to the fire?,Yes -- an excellent idea.
Oh...?,I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...,My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.,Yes, I am, sir.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.,One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.,Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.,Do you have three francs, sir?
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.,Oh, I'm sorry about that.
What's your name?,Lisette.
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.,And you, Junot?
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?,Are you trying to insult me?
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?,Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
May I offer you a drink?,Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.,You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?,No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
Were you in love with any of them?,No.
Were they pretty?,Yes.
Were any of them married?,Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
She must have been in love with you.,Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
Go away -- I'm busy.,I know what you're doing in there.
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.,Where is Madame Trillaud?
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.,Will you be joining us, soon?
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.,Five minutes.
Who is it?,It's me.
What the hell is the matter with you?,I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
You could hear them?,Yes.
Can you give me a drink, please?,Yes, of course.  What do you want?
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?,If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?,You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.,Of course, my dear.
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.,I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.,I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Those are extremely harsh terms.,I did not ask her to go to war against me.
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.,That is correct.
Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?,I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.,We have a treaty with Austria.
What I am talking about is moderation.,What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.,He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
What did you say his name was?,Eugene de Beauharnais.
Is he alone?,Yes, sir.
He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.,It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.,Alright, I'll remember that.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.,Thanks, Unc.
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.,You paid cash?
It's cool, but where's the water?,Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
Y'all never use it?,Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
I know you smoke weed, right?,Why you say that?
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?,I don't know!
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.,Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
That's a nice piece of heat right there.,Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
Who are you?,I'm his cousin.
What you mean talk to her?,You know what he mean, dude.
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.,Not me.
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?,Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.,Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.,Oh, yeah, where you work at?
Just a little.,I can't taste nothing.
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.,I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
You know what this is?,Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.,Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
What we gonna do?,I don't know yet.
Alright, Roach, see you around.,Sorry about today, man.
How you know?  It could be anything.,I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.
You go first.,Naw, you go first.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.,I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.
Karla.,Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.,I'm sorry to hear that.
I did.  Is that door locked?,It's locked.
Next time, page me first.,Okay.
What is it?,Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course.
What's the matter?,I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.,Ya'll making me look like a punk.
What it smell like?,Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down.,All damn.
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?,Have you seen Day-Day?
You see that?,I saw it.
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.,Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
I can't give you your damn money back on this.,Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
Craig, this Roach.  Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.,What up, bro?
What it say?,Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.
What is it?,Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
I do.,Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
Roach...Roach, come on.,Where's Craig?
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.,Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.,Thanks for the help.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.,Call me.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.,I know.  I'm sorry.
What you say?,He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call.,That ain't gonna work.
I can't feel my legs no more.,Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
Ezal!  Ezal!,Huh?
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?,I'll take you later.
Hey, what's going on?,Nothing.  What you want?
'Take your car?',Yeah, and hurry up.
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?,I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.,Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.,What's he doing here?
Don't remind me.,What happened here?
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?,I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.,My security people are right next door.
I appreciate that.,One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!,Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Daddy?,Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
You're out of your mind.,What's your point?
I will do no such thing.,Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.,Where did you get these? Who are you?
What would you do in my place?,Me?
What...?,Tell me why I miss him.
You killed him.,That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
Come back.,How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
One thirty. California Ballroom.,That's right. That gives you...
We have to hurry.,I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?,Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?,All right.
All right. Kisses to you.,No...kisses to you.
What do you do, if I may be so bold?,I'm just an accountant.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?,Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.,What are you supposed to do?
Oh, Jesus ...,No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.,Yeah, all right, listen...
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?,I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
Irene is going to help.,Thank you.
Thanks for the shine.,Thanks for the tip.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.,No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
You stole that.,No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?,Everybody does?
That one.,Nah.  Hates his wife.
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.,Go ahead, sugar Die.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.,He carried on some; kicked.
He never told about the money.,No.
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them.",Hm!
You killed two men, Ben Harper.,That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.,Keep talkin', Preacher.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.,Keep talkin', Preacher.
..."and I won't never tell about the money.",And I won't never tell about the money.
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...,When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
O, she's all right.,How's your sister Pearl?
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?,If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
Uncle Birdie!,Don't!
Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?,She went.
Where's Ruby?,She went.
And the Lord told that man --,Yes! Yes!
Plan on a longer visit next time.,You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?,A man of the Cloth?
Twenty-five wives!,And he killed every last one of 'em!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!,Icey, I don't want a husband.
Pearl dotes on him.,The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...,What!
Where's Mom?,She's gone to Moundsville.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.,Why?
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!,She talks to herself.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --,You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --,NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
All right boy: where's the money?,In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
Sure, that's no secret.,What's your name?
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.,Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?,But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?,Only she won't never let me play with it.
Mister Powell?,A strange woman is a narrow pit!
How's that?,She turned me out of the bed.
Get up, Willa.,Harry, what --
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.,Yes.
You were listening outside the parlor window.,It's not in the river, is it Harry?
Mornin', ladies.,How'do.
You'll whip me!,When did I ever?
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.,Now who was this?
He never asked me for nothin'.,He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.,Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.,It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
What the hell are dreams, anyway?,Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.,She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
You believe in anything?,I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?,Yeah.
The killer.,You do?
Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!,Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!,If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
Meanwhile...?,Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
Rod's not a lunatic.,You got a sane explanation for what he did?
She dreamed this would happen...,What?
He's dangerous.,You don't know he did it.
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?,Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.,It wasn't that serious...
Where you think you're going?,School.
Get into bed.,I will.
Take this, it'll help you sleep.,Right.
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?,I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.,But that's just not reality, Nancy!
Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.,So he's alive?
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...,Go on...
I never touched her.,You were screaming like crazy.
What you mean 'all at once'?,I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
Do you think I did it?,No.
Nice to have a fire.,Really. Turn 'er up a little.
No more fights?,No more fights.
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.,You should be more careful, Anna.
And you too, Ninotchka.,About what?
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.,As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
What is it, Anna?,You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.,All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...,...des raisins de Madre, des framboises... 
He's cutting our throat...,But what can we do?... We have to accept.
Misha! Misha!,What is it?
Yes! We could stay with Leon!,Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.,That's right... and we might as well face it.
Comrade Buljanoff...,Yes, Comrade?
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?,With two f's, if you please.
Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.,I think I need my glasses.
It is high time you got out of Russia.,I must be stern with you.
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.,Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?,Oh, yes, yes.
Good morning, Your Highness.,Good morning, Gaston.
Your Highness...,Yes, General Savitzky?
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.,General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
Good evening, Your Highness.,Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid.,Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.,If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crme de Bretagne... ,...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....,...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
We don't want to be disturbed.,My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
And if we have to go to Siberia...,I'll send you a muff.
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.,I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.,Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...,Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
Yes, monsieur?,Just looking around.
How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.,If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!,She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.,Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
What's that?,It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.,We did our best, Comrade.
Will you send me some cigarettes, please?  Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State.  You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades...,We did it with the best intentions...
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.,Au revoir.
Private.,There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.,You believe in our cause?
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.,So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
On what?,How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
Yes. Could you give me some information?,Gladly.
In other words you don't know.,No.
Can I help you?,You might hold this for me.
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?,No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?,Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
Is this what you call the "butler"?,Yes.
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?,Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
And what do you do for mankind?,For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
That is why I believe in the future of my country.,I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.,Ni-notchka.
That is correct.,Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.,Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
I was wounded before Warsaw.,Wounded? How?
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?,That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
Let's forget that we ever met.,I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...,You know I want to...
Then do it through my lawyer!,Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!,I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!,What?
On which boat?,Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?,Yes.
I don't look too foolish?,Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.
You remember this room?,I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
It's nine o'clock.,That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
Comrades! Comrades!,Darling, darling... please!
But, darling, you can't do that.,Comrades! Good people of France!
Are we going to build our little house?,Yes... a little white house.
No music.,No, no music.
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.,Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"
Is this the wish of the masses?,It is their wish.
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?,Please.
Hello, Leon!,Good morning, Swana.
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?,Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?,Now, Swana...
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?,No.
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.,That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
You saw all that in one glimpse?,Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Thank you.,Is this your new dress suit?
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?,Months, Swana.
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?,I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?,I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.,It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.,In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.,Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?,No.
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?,It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
The future of the common people.,That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch  la Pre Mathieu. 
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...,Where do you eat?
I am sorry... I have to leave.,Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.,You did say it, sir.
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!,But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
How's the job coming, Bob?,Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.,That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...,Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.,It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.,How so?
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.,The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.,Yeah?
I like it.  I like the idea.,Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
Where's Hunt now?,In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.,No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
No, you didn't, Bob.,Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.,Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
Sorry ...,... go on.
No, sir, you did not.,Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
I don't have a pistol.,'Night, Al.
About a dozen.,A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.,And if I stay?
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.,That's right ...
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...,It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.,Sir?
Their fourth!,It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?,Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
"National security priority restricted and controlled secret.",We'll work on it.  I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.,All right.
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...,He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...,He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
Where are they?,Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?,No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.,Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...,Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
We really must go, Mr. President.,Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...,What?
And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.,Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...,Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.,I believe you're right, boss.
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.,It's Helms -- it's got to be.
... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.,What about the documents he promised?
... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.,Sir ... six bodies.
I can't ...,Thou must.
What'd you say?,I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...,I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
Mom expects great things from you ...,Harold ... can I get you anything?
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.,Yes ...
Not if I give you all the cards ...,I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
Current levels may not be sufficient.,The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.,It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.,Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
No.,Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...,Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
I never met the man.,I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.,I know ...
Who do you think is behind it?,Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?,I always get my man.
You're fucking me.,We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?,I won't tell him if you won't.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.,Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.,That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are.,The American people put me where I am.
Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!  It's your fault, Henry.,I beg your pardon --
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?,He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.,But they all got it back again, didn't they?  We should have lunch sometime.
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.,That was Mr. Kennedy.
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.,Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.,You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.,You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.,That'll be the day.
... Use his women.,... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?,I like jazz ...
Proud?,Sir?
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.,What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...,Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.,I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
Amen to that.,It's over, Dick.
I'll concede in the morning.,Not that.  Us.
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.,That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
I'll do it.  No more.,Are you serious?
Dick, you should call Bobby.,He doesn't want me at the funeral.
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.,Do you really want this, Dick?
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?,I've missed you.
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.,They're all your enemies?
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.,Sometimes I think that's what you want.
Penny for your thoughts.,Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
Tomorrow.,Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
And what am I doing?,I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?,Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
But being out of the game gives me time to write.,To what?
Some say you are, Rocky.,The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...,No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
I am older.,Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
How fresh is this coffee?,I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
What would you a done if he'd been released?,I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
How come're you doin that?,I don't know. I feel overmatched.
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.,Most don't.
You're discouraged.,I'm... discouraged.
Hard to believe.,Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.,It's not me he's in trouble with.
Who's he in trouble with then?,Some pretty bad people.
He won't neither. He never has.,I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
Yes ma'am, I do.,Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.,The old boy shot by the highway?
That's the boy.,You figure him for a dope runner?
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.,What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money.,That's possible.
But you don't believe it.,No. Probably I don't.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.,I'm ahead of you there.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.,Yes sir.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?,Sir, I don't want to picture that.
...I love you more'n more, ever day.,That's very nice.
...Be careful.,I always am.
What's in the satchel?,It's full a money.
...Where'd you get the pistol?,At the gettin' place.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.,Well -- how come?
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.,Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
Promise?,Yes I do.
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.,Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
You are comin back, ain't ya?,I shall return.
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.,Why would I let you do that?
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.,I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
Where does he work?,Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
Hello?,Is Llewelyn there?
...You getting anything on this?,Not a bleep.
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?,Yeah. I know where you're going.
All right.,You know she won't be there.
What way would that be?,I seen you was from Dallas.
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?,I didn't mean nothin' by it.
Now. We close now.,Now is not a time. What time do you close.
This was my wife's father's place. Originally.,You married into it.
Call it.,Call it?
Yes.,For what?
Tent poles.,Uh-huh.
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.,Never mind.  I want a tent.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.,Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?,No sir, it's unusual.
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.,When did you last see him.
...I'm wondering...,Yes?
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.,I'm sorry.
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.,I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
What about one forty-two.,You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
Waitin' for my wife.,Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
Half.,What else then?
Lookin' for what's comin'.,Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
...But that won't last.,What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
I don't mean braze.,I didn't say braze.
Pot metal?,What did I say?
The heroin. You don't have it.,No I don't have it.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?,You do, I reckon.
Don't jack with me.,Yes sir.
Could I have that in American?,It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?,Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?,BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
You should get the order you want.,And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.,Oww! My arm, careful!
Jesus...,You think a woman did that?!
Did you send anyone out there?,You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!,No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
You're lying!,I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!,I know that...
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?,They're fine... you miss it?
You must be joking.,Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...,'Kay, good. Bye, then...
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?,I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?,Umm... yes. Back home.
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...,Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
Aahhh...  So what color is it?,What?
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...,I gotta go make dinner.
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.,Do what?
That's very kind of you.,The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
Oh, you mean Fred.,No, Del.
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?,You're late, Eric.
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.,She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.,I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?,Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?,No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?,Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
I have... did it sound that bad?,Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
What was that?,Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?,I came for love...
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!,Roy! What are you doing here?
What's the matter here?,I begged him to let me put that on!
Dr. David Ravell.,You mean... George McCord, the actor?
You're hurting him!!,I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
You don't sound like you're from here.,I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.,Man, that is love.
I got this apartment with a guy.,The one you were telling me about?
The Five?,Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?,Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.,God, that's awful!
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.,David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.,Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!,I have no idea what you're talking about.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!,Shhh! I heard you the first time.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.,This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
What are those for?,Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
Does he know you think he's real?,He is real.
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?,No, almost never.
Rosa, so you've met David?,Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
...this is your sweater, right?,Where are you going?
What?! That you had something to do with it?,I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...,There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
These guys are here to help you, Betty.,I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
More than you know. Is there anything else?,No, that should be more than --
The fuck you talking about?,Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
Could you give us an example?,Of what?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.,I don't follow...
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?,My socks?
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.,...and put them in your mouth.
Bourbon, little water, thank you.,Beer, please.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.,...that's a good motto.
Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.,Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.,You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!,Worse... you're in Texas.
Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.,Where? Where is she?
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...,I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!,It just didn't fit her profile...
Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?,Man, you have got to get some therapy.
I said 'got it?',...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.,What's wrong with you?
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.,What do you mean?
...and how long did she work here?,Oh, five years, give or take.
What'd you get her?,Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
Seems like a nice place.,It is, if you like idiots...
Jesus Christ!,He's waiting...
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?,No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
Is there a problem, George?,No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!,No! Let me try this!
Yeah? The sport utility?,Uh-huh.
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?,Better.
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?,Sure.
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?,Yeah. Why, you know him?
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!,I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?,She's a lesbian.
Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?,No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
Her show?,"A Reason to Love."
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.,Our pleasure, Big Dan.

Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.,We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -,Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.,That's good, honey.
That's not my ring.,Not your...
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.,You said -

I counted to three, honey.,Well sure, honey, but...
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.,It was in his bureau.
So I borrowed it till I did know!,That don't make no sense!
Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!,Pete, don't be ignorant-
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.,Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...,Isn't it, uh...
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.,Aw, that's all right.
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...,I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
Two weeks! That don't do me no good!,Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.,I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.,Great.
Come back here, kid!,What for?
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.,Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
So what're you doing in Seattle?,Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.,I joined the Navy.
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?,From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Who's that?,Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!,Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.,Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.,The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?,No, sir!
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?,No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
No, sir!,What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
I don't want to do something anybody can do.,Pity you don't have the character.
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.,Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.,It's important, sir!
Hi, son.,How're you doing, Sarge?
No, sir!,No, sir.
Louder!,Yes, sir!!
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!,Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.,I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?,I'm a little late, that's all.
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?,Let's just wait and see what happens.
That was you guys, huh?,Come on. Let's go dance.
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.,Yeah... Mmmm...
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.,Really?
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.,Not me.
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?,Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.,You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.,Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?,I've never had a girl.
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.,Any time, sailor.
Want me to get a towel?,I'll get it if you want.
My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.,God.
I've seen all that a hundred times.,Hey, will you just leave me alone?
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...,Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.,Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!,That's brilliant.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.,Hey, Sid, thanks.
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?,Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
You told us it would grow out an inch.,It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
Look at Foley! Can you believe it!,Shhhh...
You okay?,Sure.
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?,You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?,No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.,Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
What?,A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
You're welcome.,Peace out.
There is not one thing funny here.,Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
Me.  I am.,That's right.
Yes.,Remember that.
Two.  Squeeze harder.,I can't just...
You got an idea?,Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
She's gonna handle it.,She better.
Bullshit.,You know how this gotta end.
Fuck.,I know.
Fuck!,Keep your voice down.
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.,She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
What tables?  I've never seen him before.,Different tables.
Cell phone.,Shit!
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.,Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.,Yeah, whatever.
Yeah?,Everything okay?
'Bout four o'clock.,I don't get it.
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.,He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
Push that button for me, will you?,Don't!
Suit yourself.,Nobody leaves.
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?,Open the door.
Shoulda got an apartment.,Well, I know that now.
I heard you.,Feel okay?
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!,Blue is phones?
Call Dad!,On it!
He'll do something.,Uh uh.
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three...",He won't even know who it was.
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.,Stop it.
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...,He --
Where is the Glucogen?,Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
Uhh... I with it sister but...,But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
Tyrone...,Oh shit Alma... you're...
For the last time Boy!!! What do those guns mean??!!,They mean, Pig!, that the Black Panther Party declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons.  We are going to shoot you!!!
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...,That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?,You know it brother.
...The police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and Sisters you know why that is?  Because Denzil had his hands up!!,No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT?
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...,Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
Like?,Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement.
What the fuck?,Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
I expect to hear from you soon. If Huey Newton takes a crap, I want to know how big it was. Otherwise I'm gonna come looking for you. And I won't be as "friendly" as today.,I got you.
Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?,Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
Get out of the car.,What's with you?
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.,You know it. Stay Black...
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.,Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.,Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
...Glad you came man.,Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
C'mon we'll walk and talk...,Naw... I gotta...
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...,Are you finished?
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.,Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.,Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
Yes sir I was.,And did you witness the shoot-out?
Did you shoot the officers in question?,Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
We're working on that...,Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...,Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?,Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.,A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?,Yeah... let me think about it.
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?,I'm down.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?,Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.,Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?,No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
You alright?,Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
My Mom's at that.,Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
This cool the heat off you any?,I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
God damn it's him. I gotta go.,Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.,You don't look alright.
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?,No.
Congratulations.,Thank you.
Next time we'll bring more blankets.,That would be nice.
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?,It worked.  How many men can you raise?
Am I one of that sort?,You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.,His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.,Pride will do.
I know him well enough?,Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
You look well, Charlotte.,As do you.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.,Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
How did this... how did I let this happen?,You couldn't have known.
If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.,I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
Excuse me?,I said, I'm not my sister.
I know that.,Do you?
Of course, I do.,Very well, then.
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.,Lovely.
Shall we proceed?,Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
That is a separate issue.,I consider them linked.
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.,Are you going to meet with him?
And the Governor?,He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.,Yes, sir.
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.,Yes...  ... father.
Is it?,If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
How old are you?,You know how old I am.
These four wagons must be his.,And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
She spoke?  Susan spoke?,Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.,She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.,Where?
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.,And what do they know?
We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.,Go on.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.,I don't care.  I hate him.
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.,I stand corrected.
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.,I'm sorry.
We saw.,I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.,How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
It is ended.,No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.,Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
Gray.,Earned.
Not yet, Thomas.,When?
Father, you can't let them take him...,Quiet.
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?,For a little while.
Good God! Where'd you hear that?,Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
Huh?,Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
But don't you dare say that.,I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
Then why do I have to go to bed?,Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!,Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
Hey--they actually found the place!,Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
The one that goes into the woods--sure.,That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
You folks ready to go on?,Sure.
No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?,I think it is so, Ellie.
Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?,For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
But--,Does she love the cat?
I'm not climbing that.,Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?,Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.,Is there quicksand?
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?,I guess so...but...
What are those for?,Your cairn.
But--,No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.,What did we do, Jud?
You and this old Indian rag-man--,Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.,What?
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.,My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--,You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--,The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--,The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
Thank you. Thank you so much.,Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
She's finally asleep.,She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
You stole my boat.,AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
That boat is my livelihood!,You'll get it back.  Or one better.
We got that part.  Anything else?,And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.,Say the name, or I slit your throat.
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.,I'll torture it out of you.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!,Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.,See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
Why don't I want to do this?,Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
You've got sand, for a maid.,Thank you, sir.
Maid or not, it fits you.,Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --,Will -- you can't trust him.
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.,Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?,Yes -- yes.
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?,Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
What?,Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!,Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
Come on!,No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.,I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.,We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.,Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.,Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
We'd best drop canvas, sir!,She can hold a bit longer.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?,Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.,Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?,Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.,Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.,I knew you'd listen to reason!
You cheated.,Pirate.
I can get you out of here.,How?  The key's run off.
I swear, you look just like him.,It's not true my father was a pirate.
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.,My father -- was not -- a pirate!
Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.,You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
Just do it quickly.,Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --,My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
Do you have any idea where you're going?,Jack!
Are you certain this is the right way?,It's the right way.
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.,Mentioned it, is more what he did.
What happened here?,An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.,Bleak.  Very bleak.
How long do you leave him in there?,Until he's done.
We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree, Susan?,Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
I brought you up here, Dr. Bright, because I want you to understand that we are on the path.  The only difference is that you are walking with your head down, afraid to look up, to see where the path is going.,I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.,You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
How apropos.,Ain't it.
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.,The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!,Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.,In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?,Nebbleman.
And you still believe he's going to come here?,Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?,No, Icky, this is real.
Then you still love me?,Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.,That might work.
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.,Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
Hey!,You don't want this.
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?,I want Trix!  Mommy!
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?,Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!,What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?,Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?,Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.,You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
Yes?,It's Sim.  We're almost there.
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?,I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
What's it smell like?,Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Like Crazy Glue?,Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!
Susan!,Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
Somebody has to.,Same old Daniel.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.,And for cleaning up oil spills.
Susie!  You gotta help me!,Daniel, what are you doing here?
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!,Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!,Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.,If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.,That was 'simple'?
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.,What happens?
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?,That's right.
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.,You're the doctor.
Just like old times.,Yeah.  Old times.
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.,Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
No cheese.,I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
You made this out of my hair?,Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
Who is he?,The head shrinker at the prison.
Argon's private lab.,Let's go.
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!,Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.,Yeah, and what might that be?
That's impossible.,It's a miracle.
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --,Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
I could have you fired right now.,You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
Icky!,Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
Exactly.,Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.,Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?,No? Why not?
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.,I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?,Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me
Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?,Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.,My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
Your place?,Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house,When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
You have the cutest nose I've,Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!,Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.,Gallagher?
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?,I poisoned him.
I'm not going!,What are you talking about?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.,What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?,But I don't want to meet your gang.
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?,Your house?
and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.,Stewart!
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane  goes out and counts the silverware.,That's ridiculous.
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.,I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.,Oh, shut up!
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!,Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?,You're the Tribune man?
Fine. Have a seat.,Thanks, I will.
Yale '21, I believe.,Huh?
Yeah!,But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition.,Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
What do you want?,Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.,Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Yeah, little Gloria.,The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account,Do you call yourself a reporter?
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?,Yes, sir.
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -,Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
Well, when are you quitting?,Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
Is that so?,That's so.
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.,Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
And live on your salary, I suppose?,Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
What play?,My play.
Araby?,Sure.
How do you like your bath, sir?,I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?,Drunk, sir?
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.,I bet.
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it,and that
Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?,Not since you broke into society.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.,Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -,Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
Sure - I think so, Stew.,I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.,Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.,Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?,Yes.
Okay.,Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
Then how do you expect to write about it?,Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Did who?,Conrad.
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.,Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...,And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?,It'll be ready in a minute.
No.,There's nothing sudden about that  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?,No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.,You quit trying to stop anybody
I suppose you know why I came?,No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?,It's all right. Bring him in.
Come in, Joe. It's all right.,Hello, Joe.
Some bicarbonate - quick!,Double strength!
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?,Why
Stop calling me Mother!,All right, Grandma
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.,I understand, sir.
Found no skeletons?,No, sir.
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?,Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?,Well sir, I'll show you.
That's puttering, sir.,No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.,Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Yes sir.,Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.,Very good, sir.
Mary Sue?,Yeah?
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.,We're in Pleasantville?
Oh no ... I'm fine.,How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
Have you got any make up?,In my handbag.
Wait.,What?
Oh, hello Betty.,Hello Bill.
Where'd you get this?,Bud brought it to me.
Bud?,Here's my favorite.
It's alright. Let me see.,No ...
You can't go out there.,But I really should get home.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.,Yeah. It does.
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.,Oh, George ...
Sure you are.,No I'm not.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.,Where are you gonna go?
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?,Um ... It's ...
Oh yeah.,Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Mary Sue--C'mon ...,What are you doing?
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...,That's not going to happen!
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?,"Changes."
Do you know that it's illegal?,Yes I do.
Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?,Well--it was dark out ...
I think I've got something to say.,Very well ...
It's not in ME.,Oh sure it is.
How'd you know about the fire?,What?
What color is that hedge of yours?,Green.
What are you doing?,What are you doing?
Pleasantville Marathon?,Yeah. Every episode ever.
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.,Just take deep breaths.
I still don't see why we're doing this.,We're supposed to be in school.
Does he--you know--like "me"?,As a matter of fact he does.
What did you do to him?,Nothing.
I had nothing to do with that fire.,It's okay.
So what is it?,Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
Sure.,Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Yeah ...,Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
Can I ask you a question?,Yes.
Hi.,Oh ... Hi.
Sure ... Where would we go?,... Lover's Lane?
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.,You don't know?
What do we do?,We'll just put up the top.
Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?,Scout?
... Her father.,Right. And how did she dress him?
Where are you going ...,I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.,Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...,Re-runs?
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.,Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
Excuse me?,Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
Look ...,It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
Hope you're proud of yourself.,I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
How long do you think you've been here?,I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
Bud?,Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.,I'm so glad you're here.
Have you cooked the burgers?,Yes.
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.,Yeah ...
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.,There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.,What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.,Why?
Wow ... That's pretty good ...,Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
Well don't you?,I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...,No, that's not it.
TV repair.,TV repair?
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.,Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
Saw you at the mall yesterday.,Yeah ... Saw you too.
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.,"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.,It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.,That's your fault not mine.
Please don't.,She's really cute and she's really nice.
I know.,I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --,Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
Why?,I have work, I can't leave.
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?,I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
Yeah I can't.,OH MY GOD. Look at that.
You're so scared.,Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
No.,Do you like porno movies?
Sure.,Yeah....? So...Jack...are you stroking that big fat fucking cock of yours?
...just talking to you....,Are your pants off?
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.,I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
...yes...,Where is she?
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?,I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?,No.
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?,Ok. SEXY VOICE Yeah...that's it...God I Am So Horny...I wish I was there to help you.....I wish I was there for you, Barry.
I'm fine. Who is this?,Georgia.
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?,I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
I'm going to work.,Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Yes.,This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.,You don't even know how much it is.
Why did you tell me you did, then?,This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....,She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
Hello?,You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?,I don't know.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.,You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?,Are you guys hurt?
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --,-- well, if you're gonna go --
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.,Ok.
Alright?,....Hi.....
...really? That's nice...are you lying?,...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
How long have you known her?,About six months.
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?,Yeah.
Are you learning how to play it?,Yes? I'm trying.
Oh that's great.,So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --,I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
Yeah.,If you come to Hawaii --
Really?,Yeah.
Yeah?,It's Barry.
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?,About six months ago. Why?
I just wanted to make sure.,When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
Where you married?,yeah.
Ok. So you were married for how long?,Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.,What's that? What is that that you're doing?
For work.....,I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
Are you ok?,I'm fine are you ok?
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...,If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
Ok.,Ok, bye, bye.
I didn't do that.,Why? ...what?
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.,Why?
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --,I didn't do it.
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?,Hello, how are you?
Hi, is this your first time calling?,Yes it is.
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.,......and this is confidential?
And your Social Security number.,What's that for?
You want her to call you Jack?,I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.,CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.,NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
I'll say whatever I want --,YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?,Like a psychiatrist?
You ok?,Yes I'm fine.
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --,You're goin' on a trip?
No thanks.,So what should I do with the pudding?
What happened?,....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.,Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
....now: this pudding?,Yeah.
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....,How much money do you have in your pockets?
Ok.,You can't be late though.
I'll see you there.,Don't puss out.
Hello?,Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.,Sorry.
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?,Ok.
Just tell him to call me.,Ok.
So...did my brother call you?,No.
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.,It's fine.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.,My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?,Once or twice.
Has he hurt you?,His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
Ow!,But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --,I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...,By whom? The Marquis?
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?,It's not even noon --
I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?,We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --,What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?,Enough to discern its tenor.
And --?,It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.,You among them?
You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.,Do I have your word?
I have a proposition.,You always do.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.,Good day, Marquis.
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --,Valcour. His chair.
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!,Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
-- water! --,-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!,Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!,I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?,I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
It's no secret that you loved her.,Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
Don't confuse one organ with another --,I know, because I felt it myself --
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?,It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.,But he's one among some two hundred wards --
Well?,I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
It was not inspired by circumstance.,No. It most certainly was not.
I'll do everything in my power --,Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.,You'd suffer in her stead?
And you? It must've been an ordeal.,I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?,No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.,Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --",Enough!
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?,I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delben; I look to the future.
A kiss for each page.,Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...,I don't believe it!
Surely you've seen a man naked.,It's only been described to me. In your books.
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.,You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --,-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!,Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond...",Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.,I pray you: be succinct.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?,It's tainted money, Doctor.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?,Of course.
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --,Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.,It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.,You've come to lecture me?
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --,He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
So you ever gonna do a picture?,Not you too
You're just scared.,Am I?
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!,Houdini mice.
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.,Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
I see. And you are in California for what reason?,To make pictures.
Louis,Randolph!
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.,Uh-hub.
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!,There's no call for that language-
This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--,Darling, I talked to Millicent.
There. That's right.,She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
How bad is it?,Nothing for you to worry about, darling
The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.,How much?
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?,One . . . buys things.
This picture--,I am not that woman.
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?,I wanted it
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.,You will not walk out on me
I just want to understand--,No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--,I don't want you to--
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.,How so?
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. ","A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?,We're using-
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--,Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
I wanna see the picture today,That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.,He personally asked you to?
We find the man and then we dissect him-,Like a bug.
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.,No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
Jesus,Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money.
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.,We're doing Hearst.
I'll hire you  -- right now-,I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.,And what does he see?
What?,Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--,To my invaluable comrade Drink up!
Hey, kid. Gregg.,Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that,"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
Shit,George...
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.,Yeah, you're probably right.
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.,Yeah, ain't it swell?
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.,And they went to the stockholders in New York.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.,Herman.
Very generous,And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
You talked to New York?,Yes
Pardon?,CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!,Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?,The ad..
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!,It's just that my movie is so-
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.,Happy birthday.
Oh God. . .,Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--,Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
We're from...,I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
They wanna talk to you.,About what?
Hey champ!,Tommy, thanks for coming over.
What who's been sayin'?,You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
Where you going at this hour?,What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
You know?,Yeah. Do me a favor.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.,Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Harder.  Take the towel off.,Jack! Enough!
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.,What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.,I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.,She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
With her? How?,You know, like bang her or anything?
Do you see her yet?,Give me a chance. Let me look.
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.,Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.,What do you mean?
Stick out your hands, Jake.,C'mon, Joey.
What do you mean, "you"?,What?
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!,Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
Nine o'clock.,At night?
Yeah. At night.,How many pounds I gotta lose?
Three more, I figure.,Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?,I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
You said never to touch you before a fight.,If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Now, touch me...  ...here.,Oh, Jake.
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?,Nobody. I love you, remember?
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.,What did I do?
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.,All I did...
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.,You're hurting my arm.
But Jake... I didn't say anything...,Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?,What're you talking about?
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!,You did?
Open the door, Vickie.,No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --,I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
But they don't have a case against you.,Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?,He should.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.,He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
Hey, leave the kids alone.,Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.,Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!,All right, I'll try. See you later.
I said, let's go.,Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?,I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.,What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.,Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.,From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.,When the lock is broken -- yes.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.,Well, officer -- do your duty.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.,I'll bet it's been done.
His wife took a trip.,She -- was -- an -- invalid!
She never left the apartment --,Then where is she -- in the ice box?
-- until yesterday morning.,What time?
Feel a little foolish?,Not yet.
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.,Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
If possible -- both.,Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.,Give him evidence.
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.,You think he's getting out of here?
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --,All the things I hate.
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.,That depends on who "they" were.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.,Your Lisa?
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.,I told you that --
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!,You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.,I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?,Who are you?
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.,Why should I?
I can't. The police have it by now.,Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
I knew it!,Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?,Lisa Fremont.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.,She's all right.
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.,I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.,How did you know!
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.,Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.,It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.,Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.,There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?,Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
Yes.,Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.,Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?,Only because it's expected of her.
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.,It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
What would you think of starting off with dinner at the "21"?,You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.,No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --,There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.,All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.,Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?,He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?,Nothing, thank heaven.
Yeah.,Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.,To get on home.
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.,He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.,Not yet!
What doesn't?,Women aren't that unpredictable.
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?,Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.,Inside stuff?
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.,Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?,You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?,I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Nobody chickened.,I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
You know something?,What?
I thought only punks fought with knives.,Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game.
Where can we meet?,Know the Millertown bluff?
Just him.,Stay there.
I like you, you know?,Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
Mother--,You make any sandwiches?
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.,And you dropped it?
We don't have time.,We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
Go ahead.,I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
Well, just get it off your chest, son.,That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
No thanks, I don't smoke.,Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
I was talking to Jim.,Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.,A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!,Just relax, please relax!
No!,Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--,Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!,That's right!
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?,I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
Hi.,Hi there.
Boy!,What?
Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you.,I know.  That's why I came back.
I'm here.,They're still there!
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.,My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?,Judy.
What?,There's only one key.
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.,Who?
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?,Plato!
That's swell.  How are you?,I'm fine.
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?,We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
You sure?,Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.,I need it.
I'm sorry.,All right, darling.
How!,It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!,But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
Do I have to spell it out?,You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?,All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.,And they think they are protecting my by moving.
Things pretty tough for you at home?,She eats him alive and he takes it.
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.,Chicken?
Assault with a deadly weapon.,Listen--
Plato!,Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?,Who lives?
See, I'm new.,Won't mother be proud.
Yeah--why--,Dig the square wardrobe!
The kids take me.,Oh.
I'm getting that way, too.,Have you ever gone with anyone who--
Well--we're newlyweds.,There's just one thing.  What about--
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.,See, we're very modern.
How many rooms do you think there are?,I don't know.
Maybe he's scared of the dark.,Are you?
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.,Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
Judy--we're ready for you now.,He hates me.
That one?,Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?,No.  I don't even know why I do it.
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.,With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
Good evening.,Hi.
Didn't you forget something?,What?
You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.,Gabriel, let him go --
I've been doing good, though.,Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.,What, he should see me help you catch him?
Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...,Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
Toys for... adults?,C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.,Thank you.
Gotta be ten degrees out there.,Radio said negative five.
No --,One more. Smile. One more.
I told you, Nick. Remember?,Tell me again.
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --,You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
You forget where I work?,Beauty and fragrances.
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.,Nick...
...the truck driver...,He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --,What the fuck is going on.
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.,What's going ON!!!
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!,Nick, what are you --
Get the hell off of me!,Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
Nick, please, it's me --,You told him about Nick's letters.
No, Nick, no --,You're in on this.
Your pen palls dead, lady.,If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
Nick died for me....,I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
...maybe I die for Nick...,Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --,But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
No!,Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...,Don't say my name...
I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.,Nick, what are you talking about?
We need to find a way to make me part of it.,Part of... with them?
He wants to see your map.,I'm almost done.
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.,We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
You... you... YOU --,We still gonna spend Christmas together?
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.,Who wouldn't.
Merry Christmas, Rudy.,I'm glad it was me.
Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales --,Nick don't talk till Nick gets something.
You knew the place --,Hey.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?,Christmas... Eve...
Hey, it's... been two years --,We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
We walked the place for a week.,And I worked there. For a year.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.,We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.,What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?,Don't tip.
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.,...never... tried...
Start singing.,I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
No.,You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.
Ash?,How'd you know my name.
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!,What... Powwow...
I can't go back to Vegas...,OPEN IT!!!
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.,The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
Cancer-sucker.,Acid-chewer.
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?,I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
Hell yeah. You work here long?,Five years. Since it opened.
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...,Hi, Nick.
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?,Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
You gotta get someone upstairs.,How do we do that?
Here's my present to you, truck drivers --,Where the hell's Gabriel?
You knew there were guns in here!,Merlin, I didn't know --
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!,Fuckin, Zookerman --
Just a roach, Zook.,Good for you. Protein.
GUARD! GUARD!,Alamo...
Jesus, Rudy --,Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...,GUARD!!!
Ash... Ashley...,No, man! No, no, no!
Tell her... I'll be there ...,You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.,How'd you know I'd do it.
Do what?,Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --,Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!,I... sorry, Mister...
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --,I'm ninety-two years old --
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...,They changed the layout.
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.,You ain't dying, he is.
Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.,Elois?
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.,Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?,And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.,Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
The Brewers.,The Milwaukee Brewers?
Tell me more about Cabot.,He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.,What for?
Why can't we pick out our own colors?,I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
Mr. Blue's dead?,Dead as Dillinger.
What's that?,I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.,Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.,Who gives a damn?
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.,Sorry, it's my book now.
What's the cut, poppa?,Juicy, junior, real juicy.
What the fuck are you talking about?,That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.,You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?,Mr. Pink.
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.,Shit. I don't remember that at all.
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!,Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
What're you talkin' about?,That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
Why?,It's a surprise.
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.,You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?,Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.,You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
You really think we were set up?,You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!,What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
Want a smoke?,Why not?
What's wrong with it?,The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.,I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?
I got the diamonds.,Where?
No shit?,Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.,I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.,For all I know, you're the rat.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.,That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.,I don't know anybody.
Why!,I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.,That fuckin did it!
Not these guys.,Yeah, those guys too.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?,I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
And this is Helen Carter.,I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
Yes, ma'am.,As far as -- Sonora?
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.,I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?,I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.,Would you, Mr. Phillips?
So that was why she tried to run away.,Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.,The who?
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.,You're not going out to look for them?
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.,Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
You know so much about me -- figure it out.,So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?,I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.,I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.,Goodbye, Mary.
Thanks for taking over.,Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
How does she draw?,A little hot.
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?,The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
Why?,He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
I've got eleven horses.,Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.,How'd you happen to miss?
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.,I won't again.
Yeah, it does.,But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.,I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
I can't take her with me.,Nobody asked you to.
You're not bein' quite fair.,What's there to be fair about?
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.,I don't care.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?,He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
You're sure there's more where this came from?,Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
I figure we'll get along just fine.,Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
We don't want to go there.,No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.,He certainly could. About a month.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.,Maybe you are. I'm not.
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?,Stop it --
Clay Phillips.,Where is he?
We got to get movin'.,What for?
Maybe I could start you out.,That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
What do they look like?,Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?,No.
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.,Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.,I think he wants me.
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.,Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Really? That's amazing.,Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.,Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
Ray, run faster.,Okay.
So, I see you're really into spooks.,No. I never date outside my race.
I meant you're into ghosts.,Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.,Yeah.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.,Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Dude, somebody's on the rag.,Shhh!
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...,That we should take our friendship a little further?
Feel that?,No. Keep rubbing.
Listen to me I --,Listen to me I --
Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.,Oh.
What should we get?,I don't care. You pick.
How about these buns?,Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
Hanson, please.,Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
Stop touching his brain!,Um, I'm not touching anything.
Stop! --,Made you say it!
Would you like me to help you pass them back?,I don't need your help.
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.,Alright, let's take a vote...
Oh.,Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
Am I cool now?,Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.
Did you do that?,Uh, uh.
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.,I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
I got it!,That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
I'm telling you, it was possessed.,Theo, did you see the animal?
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.,There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
Got a problem with that?,Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
I think she's starting to suspect something?,Who?
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.,Saw who?!
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?,They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.,And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
Professor!,Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
Are those cameras all throughout the house?,Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.,Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.,Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?,Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
A little bit... Give me your belt.,I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
You mean to tell me we're dead!,I guess so.
Father, I think you should rest.,No, I'm fine.
"Ray!","Fucked me."
Oh, boy! ,Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.,Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!,It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?,Is there a killer loose?
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!,Let me see!
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.,Oh Mom...
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!,Looks good, Mom!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.,I'm so happy I could shit.
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?,Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
She's gonna kill Scotty!,BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
Chip, your ride is here.,Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. 
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...,We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!,You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
Beverly! Not the Sterners!,It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
"P" as in...,...People who don't mind their own business.
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".,GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!,Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!,GODDAMN YOU!
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...,It's not fair!!
So you do drink?,Socially... I'll have a beer.
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?,Yes, I was.
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... ,Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.,Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
You want me to keep that under the table for you?,If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?,I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.,Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.,Bon Appetit!
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.,Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
Are we leaving?,Yes you are.
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!,From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.,Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.,Where?
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?,Yes. She bought my sister's business.
I don't like this.,Which room is it?
Then, you also understand that you must die.,No.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.,What sort of danger?
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.,Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.,Then you know where Jacqueline is?
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.,Thank you.. .goodnight.
This is about another murder  a woman at Fifty Second Street,But you do believe me?
Yes, of course  but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.,He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.,A job?
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.,Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you - you know that?,Yes.
But I understand her. That may be more important.,It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want - surrender herself to the police  stand trial  I don't think he knows.,We could tell him.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.,And then?
You'll be all right?,Yes.
Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...,I can imagine.
It's not a searchlight  it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince - not stars --,Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me -that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?,I have to go -
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --,Don't make me tell you, Jason.
I had begun to write again -that's whet I was doing when you came in.,It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --
Jason, my pet ,Bella Romari	If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?,Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?,No, not at all, Mr. Jason.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.,Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet 	one as a detective.
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.,I'd like that.
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.,You know where she is?
It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.,Cloven hoof?
I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.,I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.,I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing -with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?,Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?,Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
I'm afraid not.,That's too bad.
That makes it all the more difficult ,Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
Is it fifteen minutes yet?,No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
But he also wrote --,I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.,I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.,It won't hurt.
That was quick.,False alarm.
Have you ever been on television?,Television?
No, not really.,Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
Oh, uh-huh.,Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
Why? Didn't you know him well?,I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.,I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
Mother, father, sister.,Sister older or younger?
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.,What's the first?
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?,I feel like they do.
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.,You had sex with you therapist?
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?,Basically, yes.
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.,Who's Donna?
Yes.,Can we look at one?
About sex?,Yes.
Like what?,Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
You just ask them questions?,Yes.
I don't... why... why do you do this?,I'm sorry this came up.
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".,I know.
Why didn't you tell me?,Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.,Why not?
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.,What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
What will you do when the money runs out?,It won't. Are you ready?
Yes.,Sometimes. Afterward.
No.,Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!,Why?
So you do fantasize?,Yes.
Have you fantasized about me?,I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
Yes.,Who was the last person you had sex with?
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.,Don't you get lonely?
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?,I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
And you feel the same way with John?,Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
But if you were?,I... I can't answer that precisely.
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?,Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
I've told you.,But I don't understand --
Who? Elizabeth?,Yes.
But you're planning to be?,I don't know. Possibly.
But that was part of it?,Yes.
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?,I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
Because.,"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
Why are you ashamed?,Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.,If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.,But I'm not.
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.,Always the lawyer.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.,Isn't therapy helping at all?
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?,I want out of this marriage.
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.,No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
I have thought about it, yes.,You bitch. I knew it.
Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?,Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
Ann, do you see a pattern here?,What do you mean?
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.,Yeah, so?
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?,Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
What brought this on?,I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.,I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.,Why, so you can go after him?
I say it because it's descriptive.,Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?,I have a pretty good idea.
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --,Will you stop? Jesus.
No, I didn't.,Why not?
Because I never got around to it.,Well, why?
No!,Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
I don't want to talk about it.,Then why'd you call me?
Questions about sex.,Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.,Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
I feel like I do.,That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?,I don't want to discuss it.
It's a sun dress.,It looks like a tablecloth.
I was just trying to --,Hold on.
So what's my share of the dress?,Thirty-two dollars.
Who are you?,I'm Cynthia Bishop.
I just want to know why you're here.,Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?,Nope.
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?,Nothing.
How do we start?,I turn on the camera. You start talking.
And you ask questions, right?,Yes.
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --,No.
I am now recording. Tell me your name.,Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
No. You'll have to get somebody else.,Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.,But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
I wish you'd quit that bartending job.,Why?
I'm intrigued.,You're intrigued?
Hello.,Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
How about inviting me over to dinner?,You know what I mean.
When?,Right now.
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.,You told Ann about this?
Who?,Graham.
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.,What do you mean?
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.,So is my wife, asshole!!
God, you need help.,I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.,No.
Give me your keys.,My keys?
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!,I'm not going to give you my keys.
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?,Goddamit...
IBM.,Brian Kirkland, please.
May I ask who's calling?,John Millaney.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.,Was he nice to you?
Jesus!,Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.,Sure.
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?,No, nothing.
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.,Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.,That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
Where is he now? Do you know?,I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.,Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.,Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.,Gonna cut me open?
Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?,I don't get it.
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?,Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
Yeah? What do I do then?,I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
NIGHT NIGHT,NIGHT NIGHT
BREAKING OUT,BREAKING OUT
Why Janet?,Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.,They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
Out of self comes selflessness.,Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
In a way...,I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.,It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.,Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.,It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.,Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
Care to indulge?,Indulge?
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?,Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?,No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT,SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
I'd forgotten.,Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
But they only think they're happy.,That doesn't make sense.
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?,OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
Brad!,I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
F for...,Flavors!
F for...,Foods!
Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.,We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.,I don't think he intends to go that far.
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD,YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD,YOU'RE NO GOOD
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...,OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
CRIMINAL,SIN-I-FUL
This could be worse than the old series.,In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...,...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
Isn't she lovely?,Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
She walks in beauty...,We love you, Baby.
No, we're from San Diego. Why?,I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.,I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?,I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.,Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
Bye.,I love you.
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.,Huh.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.,Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
My condolences.,What are you pouring tonight?
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?,Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
What do you think?,Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
You got it.,Say, is Maya working?
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.,Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
Is it chicken?,I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?,Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Hey, guys. How's it going?,Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?,Stephanie.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?,A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
Don't open that now. It's warm.,Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?,Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Just tell me.,Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
And?,I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.,Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
How old's she going to be?,Um... seventy... something.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.,I'd rather have a knife.
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.,Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
You know, you could work in a wine store.,Yeah, that would be a good move.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.,So you're going to stop acting?
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.,If that's what feels right.
It does. Feels right.,Then it's a good thing.
Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?,This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.,Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.,Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?,So what's the plan today?
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.,Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?,Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
Nice, huh?,Beautiful.
She what?  When?,About a month ago. Six weeks.
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!,I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.,You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.,Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
Get the trunk.,You have the keys.
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.,Aye-aye, captain.
Where were you?,Bathroom.
Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!,Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.,Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
You should call her.,I will.  See ya!
Right now.,Okay! Jesus!
Where is Stephanie?,Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
What?,Well, I've been doing some thinking.
Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.,Deep.
Look who's talking. You've been there.,Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?,And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.,What? Of course I like Christine.
Huh.,They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
What is it?,I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
With Maya.,Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?,Slaughterhouse.
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?,Put me down, Jack.
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.,No.
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.,Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
Do you like them?,Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.,Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.,No way. No way.
Hey, Jack. Jack.,Hrnrnrn?
Come on, let me drive.,I'm fine. You rest.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.,You need a new car anyway.
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.,See you.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.,What was the bottle that did it?
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?,I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Is she sleeping or...?,She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
Yeah, weird. But great.,Yeah. Definitely.
So what's your novel about?,Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.,A paper?
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.,So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.,What rehearsal dinner?
Ken.,Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.,Not me. I'm not drinking.
You quit drinking?,I'm pregnant.
French or American?,Both.
Should we get dessert?,We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
Where's Jack?,He had to make a phone call.
Huh.,Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.,Where?
Stephanie! Stop!,You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.,Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
There's dust in it.,This one?
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?,I heard them Morgan.
Hi sweetie.,Hi baby.
...Tell Graham --,I'm here.
And tell Merrill to swing away.,What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
I'm not going to curse.,You don't mean it. It's just for show.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.,Just make noises then.
Explain noises.,Are you going to do this or what?
No I'm not.,You want him coming in the house next time?
I cursed.,I heard.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.,That's right.
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.,The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
Chicken Teriyaki.,Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
They're on the roof.,While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
This is going to do nothing.,We have to go in the basement.
Merrill --,I'm looking!
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.,I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?,Yes.
So the aliens can't read our minds.,Oh.
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.,That means they're unemployed.
Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --,Bimboo?
What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?,Sounds made up.
Stop crying!,Don't yell at her!
Did someone save me?,Yeah baby. I think someone did.
Second thing this week I can't explain.,What was the first thing?
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --,He definitely wasn't a midget.
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.,Six months.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.,He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Is he okay?,Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
She's not in an ambulance Father.,Why not?
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.,Pinned? What does that mean?
You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.,Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them...  ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.,No money, eh?
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!,Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
I didn't know you were out.,Did it seem short to you?
Forget it.,Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
Maybe we'll see you sometime.,Yeah... maybe. So long.
I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.,You'll never make it.
I almost didn't.,Where's Jake?
Gotta go.,Right.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.,I just came out to say goodbye.
You don't make it easy on a fellow.,Didn't Paden tell you that?
You must have known that before you came.,It's one thing to know it...
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.,How's Mr. Parker doing?
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.,I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
You're not Baxter?,My name is Emmett.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.,Ten A.M.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?,I had to get up anyway.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.,Where's Turley?
I see what you like, she's mighty pretty.,And bridle-wise, too. She's the only thing I lost I really cared about.  'Cept for maybe my hat. It's a great one. Got a pretty silver band on it. My head spent three years training it.  I surely do miss that hat.
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.,Anybody got any ideas?
What happened?,They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
You own this land.,I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.,Believe it.
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.,Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.,The other guy drew first.
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.,Howdy.
You wanted to see me?,We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?,Don't press your luck, Carter.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.,You're kidding.
Why him?,Shut up. You need help, don't you?
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.,Good luck, Mal.
Yeah, it's working out real good.,Where's Emmett now?
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.,You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.,It is that.
What is it you want from me?,Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
I'm going to have to look into this.,Yeah, maybe I will too.
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --,Stella.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.,Thanks. That's what I call it too.
It's the only place I'm happy.,Me too. What's wrong with us?
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?,You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.,Who's the owner?
Where's the dog now?,He left me.
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.,That was my plan.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?,Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.,Of course.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.,I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.,You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.,Spare me.
You're not renewing my contract.,How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?,You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
Why isn't she with you?,Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.,Out of the question.  A circus like that?
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity...","Forever".
Even the fall from the plane?,Even the fall from the plane.
As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.,Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.,Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
-- You can't go in there!,-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.,Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.,Viktor, you should have said something.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?,Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
My two favorite girls.,Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
Elaine, it's Wednesday.,Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?,I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --,How much wine have you had?
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?,Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
Where are you?,Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.,Just a minute.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?,Well, I --
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.,He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.,I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Simone?,Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".,Please put your clothes on
-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?",Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.,We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.,It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.,You never were together, Hal.
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.,How did the wall get there?
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?",That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
-- Flesh is weak.,-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.,What's that?
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.,You do?
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.,Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?,We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
Hi, Dad.,Hello, sweetheart.
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.,You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
Hi, Dad.,Hello, Lainey.
How?,I read.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?,Precisely.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?,I do okay.  How about you?
You know me -- married to my work.,I noticed.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.,Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?,This is the story.
I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.,Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.,I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.,I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?,I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.,Er,... good.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.,I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.,My God, you've got one?
What if it catches on fire?,Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
You did create me.,No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.,You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.,Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.,Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
--My God.,--Do I know you?
Are you calling me?,What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
Don't step in the horse manure.,Thanks.
I forgot your name.,Dr. Crowe.
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.,You use needles?
No.,That's good.
I'm going to see you again, right?,If it's okay with you?
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.,You saw that on T.V., Cole?
You want to ask me a question?,See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
Where should I look then, Cole?,Look over there.
He hates me.,You hate him?
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?,I don't tell her a thing.
What kind of words?,Upset words.
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?,Something I want?
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--,Dr. Crowe.
No.,You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
How often do you see them?,All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
I told you what I want.,I don't know, Cole.
I have to.,When?
Dr. Crowe?,Yes.
Are you wigging out?,Yes, I am.
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.,You do?
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?,I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?,I guess she did.
It was Grandma's. It's not for playing.  What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.,You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?,Don't get mad.
She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.,What?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!,Who!
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?,Superstition.
Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!,You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
Fuck you.,Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Aha. The Lovers.,Not lately.
Suzie???,The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!,I could. You sucked.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?",Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
"With a hack-hack here --","And a slash-slash there --"
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.,Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.,I --
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!,Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.,Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
You know what they say about men who need big guns...,Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.,What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
Shit!,Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Yeah. That's just the problem.,Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
What about Jeremiah?,Nah. Just you.
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --,Let it go.
No Mac, please... I --,Don't look.
I almost thought for a second...,Never.
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.,What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?,Like what?
-- Where have you two been?,Us? We been... moonlighting.
Carl.,CARL??? Carl did this?!!
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.,What'll we do?
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!,Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
What?,Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
Pretty, ain't they?,I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Grant, where'd you go?,Hey, Grant.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.,Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
What?,He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.,Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!,Shelby --
Where's the old half--Mexican?,Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.,What?
Meat.,Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
Sure thing, killer.,What can I do you for?
It's just a work thing.,Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
I never danced in a towel before.,Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
Welcome home.,Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.,My present?
Who's that?,It's just one of my students, Grant.
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.,And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
Where'd he go?,We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
Praise Jesus.,'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
You.,Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.,America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.,What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.,You know how rumors start.
Who'd want to?,I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.,It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
But you could get killed, right?,Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
An existentialist.,A what?
So tell me about yourself.,Okay.
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?,Having fun.
Is this fun?,Driving?
What the hell's going on?,I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
Anything?,We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
Can I ask you something?,Shoot.
You know this guy, don't you?,I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
By stealing my car?,I would've come back for you.
Yeah.,Yeah.
Where did you learn how to drive like this?,Like what?
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?,Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?,You plan on driving trucks all your life?
An unmarked police car.,How do you know?
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.,It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
What kind of a guy is he?,The minute you see him, you'll know.
What are you thinking?,You gotta admire the man's determination.
I'm begging.,I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.,You sure do.
What's your pleasure?,Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?,Another time.
Or in the slammer.,Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.,Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.,If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.,Go.
If I say go to two, it's really one.,Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.,I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Loud and clear.,Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
Liquid gold.,Redneck heaven.
You know how to drive one of these things?,Can a pig whistle?
We still on schedule?,Forty-two minutes ahead.
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.,What's your twenty?
Do I have a choice?,What's your twenty?
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.,I ran into complications.
I'm all ears, good buddy.,You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
Just fine. What's the weather like?,God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
I'm all ears.,You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.,What's that, pardner?
Breaker. Breaker.,Go breaker.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.,Go head on, breaker.
Breaker. Breaker.,Pick it up, Breaker.
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.,I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
That crazy sumbitch made it.,Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?,-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?,No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.,And a very bad gamble.
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.,Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?,Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
Did he give you his name?,Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
You investigating those murders out at the lake?,Ww... uh...
But there were more of you?,Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.,Damn... alright then.
Are you on a land line?,Yeah, why.
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.,That's not possible. I told you.
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.,Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --,-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
I'm here, where's the car?,I sent Hugo, he should be there!
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?,Your attitude sucks.
Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.  There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup.,Then what --
D'you talk to'm?,I got his machine.
No, what did you say on the machine?,I left him a message.
About what?,Look at the collar on that coat...
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?,Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
...I'm sorry...,Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!,That's right! RIGHT NOW!
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!,That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.,I thought Heller was a double op?
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...,-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
...When did you know all this?,Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --,It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
I wouldn't go that far.,But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.,I'm here.
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.,Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
No shit.,None whatsoever.
So how we lookin'?,Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?,Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --,Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.,Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
-- never in a million girl --,-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
For real?,Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
We gotta lay something out, strategy- wise. Somethin' tight. Y'go in there ad-libbing, it's y'ass.,What are we talkin' on the split...
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --,I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?,The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --,-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
What's wrong?,Security's locking down the elevators.
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.,...What are they doin' right now...?
Bulllllshit...,Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.
Gibarian.,Leave the light off.
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.,Can it work?
Listen --,We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?,Yes.
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.,How quickly?
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?,Yes.
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?,He's dead.
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.,Who was it?
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.,Will she come back?
What will you say?,To who?
Kelvin, you awake?,What is it?
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --,-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.,I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...,Her oxygen would have run out.
Don't.,Why?
We're taking a flight?,Yes.
Rheya...,I want you inside me right now.
You go home.,I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
Then it's God, right?,It's something.
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.,How old were you?
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --,I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.,I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
But that's what happened before.,Not this time.
Do you want to stay here?,Do you?
What's wrong?,Gibarian.  He was here.
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.,I love you.
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?,I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
It wouldn't have made any difference.,Thank you.
I wish you wouldn't.,They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
What are you taking?,A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
Snow, get up here, now.,I'm not Snow.
Claire!,Hello, Win.
Uh...,I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
Right.  That's true.,Can we go then?
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.,If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
Didn't do very well, did you?,Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...,Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?,Absolutely.  Look at this.
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!,Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
Yeah.,That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
Good night, Mike.,Sleep good.
You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.,Claire, will you calm down?
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.,Claire...!
Yeah.,They called here after you left...
They guys treatin' you all right?,Yeah.
How long you going away for?,Long enough.
... Mike.,It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
You still going away?,I don't know...
I like your coat.,You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.,It was something my father always liked me to do.
... just saying you should think twice about it...,... I don't want to talk about it...
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...,Claire...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...,Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?,Sure we are, let's go!
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?,I don't know Tommy.
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?,Absolutely.
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.,Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
My ass is falling.  It is.,What are you talking about?
Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?,You got no idea...
For how long?,'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
What shit, honey?,You don't want to hear about it.
I'd identify him.,I might stop you.
Why?,I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.,I'll be right up.
Mike, take it easy...,Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
What did you do tonight?,I watched TV.
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...,Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...,You talked to his wife?
Let me drive...,Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
What about when she identifies him?!,If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.,Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!,I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
... Hard?,Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
You're here 'til what time?,I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
Hold it...!,I'll prove it!
How do I know that's her?,I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
Why should she come in?,She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
Bullshit!  Prove it.,Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
Let my kid go.,I'm not lettin' no one go.
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.,Lay back, Mack.
How are things going, pal?,Okay, I guess.
She's what?,She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.,You stop him?
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--,Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University.",Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times.",I know.  I've got one too.
Are you okay?,Get away from me, freak!
How are you doing, kid?,Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.,I think you're trying to tell me something.
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?,Can I get a word in edgewise?
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--,I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Would you cool it already?,Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.,Hmf-hrr?
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.,How about tomorrow?
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--,Just call me Spidey.
Some things you should say anyway.,Even if they're not clever.
It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.,Huh?
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.,Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.,Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
My my.,Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
God, Flash can be such a jerk.,But you like that in a man?
You should write that one down.,"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?,Hi, Adele.
What's in the bag?  Garbage?,Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?,That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.,You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
Well, no.,So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
Peter?,I'm here...
Toxic dumps, huh.,And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?,Precise equipment such as waldos
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--,Oh, Peter. A zit.
It's Friday night...,Yes.  Do you have a date?
The record--,It'll shut itself off.
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.,You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.,How is he?
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.,Let's talk in the hall.
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!,Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Mr. Parker.,Hi, Professor.  What's up?
Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.,Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
You never know.  Go get some sleep.,I'll try. Thanks.
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?,Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
Where'd you get the clown suit?,Like it?
So they're airing this tonight?,Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?,What?
Up here, Docky Ocky!,No, no!  Not there!
What's wrong with him?,Plenty.
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?,You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Jawohl!,Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?,Just pulled the old match gag, see!
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.,Looks good outside.
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?,Yeah. Security.
Private property, bub.,How come the Krauts knew about that stove, Security? And the tunnel? How come you can't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it?
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?,Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.,You stink, Sefton!
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.,And maybe a little something else?
Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.,Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
You make my mouth water.,You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
Have a cigar.,Thanks.
I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.,You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.,We're looking at it.
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.,Okay, Security -- what happened?
Break it off!,How much more do we have to take from him?
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?,Which one of you is what?
I'm okay here. Why bother?,No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?,I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.,He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
Jawohl?,Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his English? In a pretzel factory?,You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!,Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
You can say that again!,I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!,Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!,Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
Let me go! Let me go!,They'll shoot you, Animal!
It's chow, Animal! Chow!,Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
Easy, Animal! Easy!,Where'd that come from?
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.,It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?,Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!,He's the grrrrreatest!
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?,Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
Do Grable.,Hey, here's Esther Williams.
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?,Animal! Got a little something for you!
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!,Let me alone.
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!,There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.,Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.,Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.,You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Los, los. Dummkopf!,Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.,Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
Anybody call?,Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.,A little weak today.
What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?,I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.,Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.,You starting that again?
What are we going to do with him?,Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
You could use a new one yourself.,Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Shapiro. Shapiro.,Just what makes you so popular?
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?,Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.,Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
Which one of us is the informer?,You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.,You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?,Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.,Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
My grandmother's ear-muffs.,Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
So you're stuck with me, eh?,Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
Where is he now?,I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.,Thanks for pointing that out.
Captain=8A,I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...,Twelve years, sir.
Data, are you all right?,No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
What do you mean?,I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
Population?,Approximately two hundred thirty million.
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.,I have to find a way to get to Soran.
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?,It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
Really? What do you feel?,I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.,I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.,It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
Data, are you all right?,I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.,There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-,Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.,Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
Where is he now?,Wherever he wanted to be.
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-,I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
Well, may we have a look around?,Please, please.
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.,No, no. Thank you.
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.,I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?,You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
Antonia?,She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
Close to retirement?,I hadn't planned on it.
How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?,That's right.
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.,And what would that be, sir?
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?,It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.,Phasing? To where?
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.,Where are the deflector relays?
Keep her together until I get back.,I always do.
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?,No.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?,Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?,When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.,Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.
Sir?,Make it so.
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?,We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.,You want me to contact Starfleet?
That's a pretty big margin of error.,Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
Counselor. What can I do for you?,Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.,My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
You must think I'm quite the madman.,The thought had crossed my mind.
The Nexus.,Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.,Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.,Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
Will we get another ship?,I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.,What did you see, Chekov?
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.,Scotty...?
Why don't we beam it up?,Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
David, I don't understand...,I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!,... Fascinating.
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...,Short range scan.
.          .. Spock's tube...,David --
What is it?,Spock's burial robe.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!,Logic indicates that is the case.
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?,Not exactly.
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...,... How long?
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.,You said there wouldn't be any.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?,Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.,I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.,Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
How many more?,Just him, sir!
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.,And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
Yes, yes, Spock...,The ship... Out of danger...?
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.,Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
Count on our help, sir.,I'll need it, Sulu.
... We have cleared Spacedoors.,FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?,... A cloaking device?
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.,Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --,Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?,Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!,Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
Genesis, I want it.,Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...,I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
Yes, I was...,Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
... He spoke of your friendship.,Yes...
... The needs of the many outweigh...,... The needs of the few...
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.,But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!,Yes... But -- how...?
Share this with no one.,Understood, my lord.
I ordered no interruptions.,But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
Range: 3000 Kellicams.,Steady. Continue on impulse power.
Firing range, sir.,
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.,Put him on screen!  Study him well.
Sir, may I --,Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --,They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.,Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.,You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!,Good for you, Lieutenant.
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?,This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
Physician, heal thyself.,That's all you have to say?
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --,More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
Shore leave, Admiral.,Ah.
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?,Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
Now that's what I call a meal.,It's like the Garden of Eden...
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --,Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.,I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
... Can't read you... repeat...,Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...,Carol!
David. Please.,This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.,You know what she'll say...
Are you sure these are the coordinates?,Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!,What's the matter -- ?
But the child --,Never mind! Hurry!
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --,<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
It's the Genesis Wave!,What?
What are you looking at?,The Admiral's son.
They won't --,<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
Departing dark side, Regula.,Visual --
Thirty seconds...,... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
Time's up, Admiral...,Here it comes. Now, Spock.
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.,KHAN!
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.,Listen to me -- you men and women --
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?,I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?,Aye, sir.
We'll be going to warp speed --,Aye, sir --
... No response, sir.,Sensors, Captain?
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.,I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?,I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.,No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.,Admiral, this is Spock.
Yes, Spock.,Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Is the word given?,The word is given: warp speed.
I know of your fondness for antiques.,'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?,Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.,Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
What's she doing here?,Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?,It would explain a great many things --
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...,At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
The prefix code?,It's all we've got.
Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent...,Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.,Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
A distinct possibility.,Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.,Steady as you go...
Kirk here.,I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...,Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Very well.,I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?,You may ask, Lieutenant.
On screen...,We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
Indeterminate life signs.,Phasers on stun. Move out.
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...','... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
That was close --,They just don't want us going in there.
Mr. Saavik, all stop.,All stop, sir.
Stop engines.,Stop engines.
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.,Try again.
We are clear and free to navigate.,Course heading, Captain?
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.,Aye, sir.
You lied.,I exaggerated.
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.,Where must you go?
I do this because I was there,,Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
Heard there was some excitement.,Just a couple of kooks...
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --,I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.,Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?,A moment alone, please.
You sure this is such a bright idea?,What do you mean?
Bones --,Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
Bones, stay here.,No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
Now wait just a damn minute.,Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
Oh, joy.,Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
What did you say she was getting?,Cramps.
He's coming 'round, Jim...,Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.,Not me, Bones... They did it.
Hi... Busy?,Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?,I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
You're joking...!,A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.,... My God...
You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.,Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
... I don't think he understands...,No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
Find it?,Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.,I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.,That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
Shields, Mr. Chekov.,Shields, aye.
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.,Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
Status report, Admiral!,Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.,Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
Attempting the hell to communicate.,Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.,I suppose they told you that...?
You sure you won't change your mind?,Is there something wrong with the one I have?
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!,How soon?
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.,LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
Thanks.,Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?,Go ahead.
No, ma'am. No dipshit.,Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
Where could you take them?,Hm?
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?,It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.,What do you mean now?
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.,But Kirk...
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.,All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
You mean this is -- goodbye?,Why does it have to be goodbye?
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.,That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.,What is our target in time?
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.,What are the variables...?
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.,You've programmed that from memory...?
Earth... But when?... Spock?,Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?,And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
Spock...,Yes?
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.,I see.
Spock: Condition report!,No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.,I will, Admiral.
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!,... Aye sir...?
I have no control, sir!,Picture, Uhura!
I can't, sir -- Nothing!,Out of control, and blind as a bat!
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.,Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.,Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?,Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...,Mr. Sulu?
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...,How long, Scotty?
Admiral! There be whales here!,Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...,Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
The whales...?!,No power to the bay doors.
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?,That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Right on. You fly?,Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.,Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?,Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
Don't panic...,I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.,We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.,But not you.
A perfect moment?,When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...,Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
Jak'tahla?,Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...,By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...,What's the rush?
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...,This way!
Mother and son. You arranged this...?,I thought it might begin the healing process.
Chase me!,For what purpose?
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?,Androids... don't have...fun.
Anij!,Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
Hello, Data...,Captain, Geordi...?
I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.,It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
A ship,,It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...,Will the structure hold if we blast through?
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.,He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...,Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?
I do not take orders from you.,If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...,That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
You're not finished here?,Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.,Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...,... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.,Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...,Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...,Scan for lifesigns.
I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.,They... are in opposite directions, sir...
I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...,Do you know how they were damaged?
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.,The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
Full impulse.,The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
Will that stop the tear?,You got me, Commander.
That's your expert opinion?,Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...,If it works you mean.
They're powering their forward weapons array.,Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.,... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...,We're not going anywhere.
You must be planning on doing some hunting.,Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...,Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
My name is Sojef, Captain.,Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Worf, you must hurry...,We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
Come out, come out wherever you are...,Sir?
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?,No, sir...
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...,Picard to Crusher...
One. It's Ru'afo.,Can you beam him off?
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.,You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.
Wine, women and song.,You should feel right at home with them.
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...,Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
What you're doing to my neck...,Was I doing something to your neck?
Come in.  Hi.,Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...,... I believe you...
Initiate launch sequence.,Activating injector assembly.
Exactly as the simulations predicted...,Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.,All ship functions are off-line.
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?,Absolutely.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.,I look forward to reading your report.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?,We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
It's Cochrane.,I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
You think they're still up there?,If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
How long has he been unconscious?,At least four hours.
Yes...,Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
Isn't it better like this...?,Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
Can you configure it?,I believe so.
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.,I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.,Let's go.
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.,There should be some kind of manual release...
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.,Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...,We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
What's still there?,Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
Entering the upper ionospere...,There's a red light on the second intake valve.
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.,As they used to say... all systems are go.
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.,<U>Engage.</U>
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...,I'm on it...
ATR setting...,Active.
Jean-Luc Picard.,Great name. French?
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...,I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
You seem to have an answer for everything.,Something wrong with that?
Invasion.,These people you're calling "Vulcans"... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?
Were the two of you... involved?,No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...,No. It's a lot further than that.
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.,Data, set a course for that vortex.
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...,Steady as she goes.
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.,Onscreen.
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...,They did it... they assimilated Earth.
Captain?,In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?,Unless you'd like to stay.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.,Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
Someone...?,The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Worf to Bridge.,Riker here.
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?,There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
I believe the operation is over.,The charge is murder.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...,You may need assistance, doctor...
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...,Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
Or not to be -,That's the question -
Figures.,We've been set up all along.
Specifically of...?,No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.,That cunning little Vulcan...
ABSOLUTELY NOT!,Come on...
Too bad we can't SMELL her.,In space, no one can hear you sweat.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.,If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
Are you carrying a surgeon?,We were until your torpedoes!
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?,Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.,Stand...?
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?,Barely.
I was nervous -,You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
They'll respect him now...,That's a comfort...
It takes a lot of effort.,I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
Would you care to go topside?,Very much.
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.,There... were no other ships in the sector.
You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?,Well, I -
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?,I am.
Just the size of my head -,I know what you mean...
Torpedo room--?,Uhura, monitor!
Where IS the conference?,She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.
She's here - somewhere.,But if she's cloaked...
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.,ALL uniforms?
Thank you, Captain.,Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.,He's got it.
How did you know...?,There's a reward for your death.
We don't get many presidential assassins.,We didn't kill Gorkon.
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.,Anything else you want to tell me?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.,There's gotta be a way out of this place...
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.,Except us.
I know how to get outside the shield.,Where do we come in?
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.,Candidate for what?
Aft thrusters -,Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.,Sulu!
Standing by, Captain Kirk.,You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.,Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -,Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
What is it?,I am uncertain.
Where?,Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
We HAVEN'T fired -,According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
Are you dining on worms?,You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.,I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?,Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
I SHOULD have been -,Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
Close enough to beam down?,Not yet... Section 4236...
Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?,I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.,Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -,We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
And if they're still in place?,Then someone forged a data bank entry.
Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.,I know precisely where he'll be.
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...,Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?,At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.,But you didn't join a conspiracy.
I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I dont show up for my physical on time!,It'll serve you right.
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?,Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.,But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.,Dying?
He is very observant.,I can see that.
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.,Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.,On my way.
Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.,They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?,Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
Do you think this is a wise course of action?,We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Ready, Captain.,Fire!
Yes.,I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.,He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin,No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
You have a red shirt.,This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.,I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
Yes.,Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.,The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... Im a talking head.
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.,Is he sincere about wanting peace?
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.,Make it so.
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.,This isn't real.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.,You sick bastard!
No.,I can feel your desire, Deanna.
Cannon fodder.,Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.,And that's exactly what he's going to do.
What's he doing?,He wants to look me in the eye.
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.,Sir, we wont be able to bring you back. Its a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
Sir, we're being hailed.,On screen.
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.,That will never happen.
We're being hailed.,On screen.
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.,Who was it?
What's this?,Your new chair, sir.
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.,Still well on our side...
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.,Thank you, sir...
It's working.,Counselor?
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.,She's a predator.
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.,Can anything be done for him?
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.,She's the most beautiful ship Ive ever seen.
Serving with you has been an honor.,The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.,Praetor Shinzon?
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.,And the Senate supports you?
Right now, youre thinking this all sounds too good to be true?,Yes.
You know I need to verify this.,I know.
And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.,What happened?
You don't trust me.,I have no reason to.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.,There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
So I'm not as tall as you expected?,I always hoped I would hit two meters.
What are you doing?,I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.,Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
Yes.,So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
That's your life... not mine.,Please.
Its too late.,You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Target disruptors. Destroy them.,Disruptors are off-line, sir.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.,Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
The bond is broken.,Find her again.
No -- this is wasting time.,Do as I tell you!
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.,The Scimitar will serve my needs.
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.,
Benny, God, take it easy...,I don't want to scare them away.
Don't you think you should call a backup?,No, we can handle this.
Gate three. It's boarding now.,Thank you.
You have one with two beds?,Sure.
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.,Thank you.
Where did you stop last?,What the hell do you think you're doing?
Where did you stop last?,Stay right there...
Then it's not an accident that they found us.,We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
Clarify that.,It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
Hello George.,Shermin...
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.,We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.,You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
I just retired.,Shermin!! Shermin!!!
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.,You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?,Marc Shermin.
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.,Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
Mrs. Haydn...,He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
Please.,Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever...
Steering wheel...,What.
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?,We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
What?!,Minneapolis.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...,What are you doing?
Closed?,You'll see.
What?,Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?,I am Jenny Haydn.
No gas.,I know.
I am husband?,No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
No.,Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
In your pocket, please...,You. Mouth closed.
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.,No.
What's the matter?,Shit!
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!,It was yellow.
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?,Yes. Day... night.
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...,'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.',You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
Well... I'm going to go now.,Go?
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.,Goodbye.
Jennyhaydn.,Yes?
What happened?,I was afraid.
You did? That's funny. So did we.,Yes?
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.,I understand.
What are you doing?,Are you my friend?
Yes.,I am your friend.
Nobody knows.,Why?
I will go. But not you.,You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
No one's traveling in this weather.,You promised you would get me to my ship.
I will. I will. We still have another day.,You promised.
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?,I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.,I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
May I have twenty-five cents, please?,What for?
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.,I know how to gamble now.
The cook again?,Yes.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...,This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
How long will it take you to get home?,Many, many days and nights...
There.,Where?
Help me!!,You could have killed us both!!
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...,Call the police!!
I don't know where he is.,This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
Wait. Could I have your autograph?,Sure.
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.,I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?,It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.,You know that's impossible!
Is there a reward in this?,Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.,Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
Yeah, that's right.,I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.,Just not the eyes.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.,Leave him alone, Tran.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.,You're too goddamned paranoid.
You said you were going to get her out of this.,Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
You can't just... kill him.,I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.',Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.,I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
Faith, call me, okay?,No, Lenny.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.,I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.,Tell me.
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?,We should talk alone.
You think Tran killed her?,The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
Sounds good.,I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?,You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.,Least you can do.
That's not sayin' much.,It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--,Shutup a second!
Let's work it.,Not now... I don't want to think about it--
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.,He records himself raping and killing her--
Top ten.,He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.,I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.,Okay... what about Strickland?
No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.,Only way I could stand your ties.
You just did.,Jesus!
Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?,That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
How did you hook up with Faith?,This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.,Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.,Who was just here?
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.,What clip?  What was it?
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?,You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
About what?,That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
It's alright.  He means it.,I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
Nero.,Strickland.
Commissioner Strickland.,Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?,Your sex life?
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.,Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.,Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.,Define illegal.
What's his name?,Fumitsu.
I need my case.  It's still in the back.,Get it.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.,Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Forget her.,She still loves me.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.,She's my destiny.
He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.,So that gives you something.
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.,It's not your fault.
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.,S'okay.  I know you still love me.
Lenny, give them the tape.,It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
Those two guys were cops.,You sure?
There's a plus side?,Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.,Why?
He's totally cut off from the outer world.,How long does it last?  Oh.
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...,Yeah, right, blow it open.
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.,Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--,Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
Mace... you're a girl.,Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
Right.  That explains it.,Are you going to make me beg?
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --,Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
I've been looking for you.,Why me? What do you want from me!?
What did he look like?,I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.,What are you doing?
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.,Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.,"Was?"
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.,How long ago?
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.,What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
Why did you go to Chicago?,I was visiting an old college friend.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.,I didn't use Low's name.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.,How long have you been downtown?
Doesn't fit.,This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.,That information's being withheld from the media.
What about the chat rooms themselves?,That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.,"Gone live?"
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month.",This is some serious shit.
Look at this fellow... or this one.,Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?,My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?,He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.,Don't be too harsh.
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?,Huh?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?,Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.,No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
There are Agency regulations about this.,"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
He's called a couple times.,What did you tell him?
Find the feet?,No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
Jesus.,We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
The tattoo?,Sue Ann Hanson.
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.,Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.,No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
Maybe we should back off a bit.,I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
Then there's the other issue.,What's that?
Start killing people for real?,Suspect Zero.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.,But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.,I guess I'm a little paranoid.
You're putting me in a difficult position.,I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
You okay?,Yeah, of course.
It's quite advanced.,Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.,That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.,I...
Jaime --,It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
Mack must think Zero has a police band.,Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.,No weapon.
What was your weakness, sir?,I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
Suspect Zero?,Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.,Zero killed them all?
We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.,Maybe you should back off.
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?],Lead the way, Murman.
If I owe, I will go.,[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.,[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.],Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
Let's talk about Zero.,[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
I want to help you.,[Not the heart, the watch.]
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.,So you're the new meat?
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.,I screwed up twice, sir.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?,I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
No.,Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
I don't...,Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
You've been through worse.,You're right. I know.
Ever since I've known you.,I don't know about that.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.,It didn't feel that way.
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.,Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
Are you calling Her?,No. Stop, come on.
How are you ladies doing this evening?,What do you drive?
You like laughing at the misery of others?,I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.,I'd say about two weeks.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.,Why? You're not a real man?
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.,Just like that?
...not until you book it...,...and even then...
Hi.,My pleasure.
The poor thing. Six years?,...And she's with someone else.
A couple of high rollers like you?,Could you believe it?
Do you have anything smaller?,Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.,Why not?
How's it going? It's been a while...,...Six months.
Good.  I think about things.,Yeah?
Well that sucks.,It sucks.
Unless she comes back first.,Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...,Hey man, don't sweat it.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.,You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?,I didn't want to say anything.
Why?,I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
I don't talk about her that much.,Oh no?
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?,To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
That doesn't sound too good for business.,It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
Darwinism at its best.,I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.,Well, let's hit that party.
Him?,He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
There are so many beautiful women here.,It's unbelievable.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.,Go for it, man.
What's dumb about it?,Well, you're doing so well...
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?,Sure.
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.,You always know the right thing to say.
You little bitch!,Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.,Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.,So, what? Eleven?
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...,...He's derivative...
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.,I can't believe you.
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...,Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Good for you, man. He's being smart.,She's really special, guys.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. ,Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. ,I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.,Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
That's where we make our scene.,You think they're watching?
I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven.,Yeah? Well obviously not always!
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.,Yea, how much?
You think so?,You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.,Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
I don't know...,You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...,Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
Nice, baby.,I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.,No! Not the camera guy!
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.,Hold on.
I don't think so.,I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.,That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
I just need some time...,Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
No. Doesn't that suck?,What? That was the best part of the old game.
Please, don't mess with me right now...,We're not messing with you...
Tomorrow?,No...
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.,Oh. He's got it under control...
What a surprise...,...How novel.
Now?,No.
Yes she did.,Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
It's on.,You think?
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...,You are so money, and you don't even know it...
...and big fuckin' teeth...,...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...You're just poking at it...,...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
You're money.,Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...,...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...,Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
It's on...,...it's on.
And you?,I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.,You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
Be my friend.,Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...,Go back to your house and wait for me...
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.,Like hell I will.
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.,The gun will be there.
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.,How bad will it be?
You look terrif on the floor!,What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
I'll think about it.,Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.,Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.,He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
You take care of your family?,Sure.
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.,It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.,Should I bring him in.
What is this nonsense?,It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
But you needed a drink first.,Yes.
What miracles you do for strangers.,I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
And now, what do you choose to do?,I'm going to finish school.
Accept what's happened, Michael.,I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?,Yes.
...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war...,Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
Things went badly in Palermo?,The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
What is it?,Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
Ever seen anything like that before?,No.
Mike!  The party starting!,Come here a minute, Fredo.
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?,Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.,We're all tired...
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.,And when they shot me father...
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.,Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?,How will they come at you?
Michael, what are those men doing?,They're waiting to see my father.
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.,Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
What will your father say?,As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
Michael, what are you doing?,Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
Can you say it?,Huh?
I don't think so either.  I better go.,When will I see you again?
Tell me!,All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.,How's Mom?
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.,Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
How can you be sure?,On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
That's not how Pop would have played it.,I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
All right, Sonny.  All right.,Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Send some bodyguards.,I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
Mikey, you look beautiful!,Cut it out.
We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.,The kid's right.
A million times.,Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
We're going to New Jersey?,Maybe.
Do you renounce Satan.,I do renounce him.
Let us fill up our Regimes.,No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.,He talked to you?
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!,Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
You straightened my brother out?,Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.,You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?,Sure. Any time.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.,Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
You'd say if you mind?,No, I like him.
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.,Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
I met him in New York.,Marge! You've got to hear this!
You like jazz!,I love jazz.
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?,You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
You're breaking my ribs!,What?
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?,No! I've got more than one shirt!
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?,No!
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?,Relax.
Shoes too?,You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
What are you talking about?,You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.,I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...,I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.,That's good.
I've got plans!,Ripley's plans.
Ha.,Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.,Really? To Italy?
Do you think you can steer this thing?,Sure.
Hello?,Dickie?
Who is it?,It's Freddie. Let me in.
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?,No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
Tom.,Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --,Such as?
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?,I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.,What's going on?
Dickie!,I'll go and see what's the matter.
What?,Get on. I'll take you to him.
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.,No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
Hello Peter, so good to see you.,Hello Marge!
Very.,And you, sir? Any better?
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.,Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
I told you. He gave them to me.,Why? When?
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --,Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?,You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
Where's Dickie's father?,He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
What's your secret?,Excuse me?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.,My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --,How did you know that?
Let's go.,I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...,Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
So -- are you travelling under R?,You know what -- I am.
And tomorrow?,Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?,Ten thirty?
I've been backpacking.,I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?,No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.,You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
Tom, are you okay?,You try. You try talking to her.
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?,I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.,I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Or Tom and Peter even.,Well that would be even better gossip.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.,Peter, I... I...
Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...,You're such a liar...
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?,I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
I really don't want to see anybody.,Even your fiance...?
I don't remember the exact date.,And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
A few days ago.,Does he stay with you here?
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.,Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
I have!,You have, yes.
How much to get a permit to carry?,Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
Nah, this'll be fine.,You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?,Huh?
Yes?,My name is Travis.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?,I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
What kind of people?,Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
What did you do?,I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
Huh?,Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
The singer?,Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
So you haven't heard this record yet?,No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
But this is a porno movie.,No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
Where are you going?,I'm leaving.
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.,No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Huh?,It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
I see where Palantine got the nomination.,Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
Travis?,Yeah.
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.,I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,,No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.,Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?,I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.,With the other hand, right?
No, I'm serious, really...,Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.,We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!,No.
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.,What did you do?
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?,Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.,Stick up?
Where.,In the jungle. 122nd.
I have.,You carry a piece? You need one?
That ain't much of a name.,It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
Why? Who are you?,I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?,Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Well, you want to or not?,O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
God, you are square.,At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
Who's a killer?,That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.,Huh?
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.,He shoots dope too.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?,Me? I could never go to a place like that.
What's so important?,I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
What should I do? Call the cops?,Cops don't do nothin.
You don't have to.,I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
No.,Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.  Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?,No Sir.
There's porno theatres for that.,I know. I tried that.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.,Physical? Criminal?
Also clean.,Age?
So I hear.,Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.  Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.,You would, huh?
Here, officer, take me in. I'm clean. I didn't do it. Got a ticket once in Jersey. That's all. Honest, officer.,Your name Sport?
I'm hip.,Funny, you don't look hip. 
Travis.,Hey Wizard.
Real down.,It happens.
He's got a gun, sir.,What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!
Motor oil?,For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
God's speed.,Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!,And  I love you, Pete!
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.,Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.,I had it, a minute ago...
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.,How'd they get it inside?
Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others.  I knew them all.  So did you.  We went to school with most of them.,It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
I'm sorry.,No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
What was that?,Nothing.  
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.,Oh.
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.,Oh.
Your dancing's very good.,Thanks.
Sir, that is true.,Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Yes... yes, I do.,Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Yes it does.,Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?,No, sir.
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?,I'm not refuting anything.
Yes.  A prepared statement.,Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
I'm a little hesitant to say.,The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.,I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.,Mr. Appleton, you will...
Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...,Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
Mother o'god...,Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.,What's that?
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.,That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.,A super market.  Huh.
Nine and-a-half years ago.,Nine and-a-half years...
They couldn't wait to see you.,Who... are they?
This is the staff of the Bijou.,Oh.  What... what time is it?
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.,You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
Carl.  Friend of yours from high school.  Everybody calls him "Cueball.",Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.
Beautiful, wasn't it?,Yes.
Ha!,... what?
Luke... what time is it?,Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
Did I what?,Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.,You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?,Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.,I guess I did.
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.,It's possible.  I just don't remember.
What's wrong?,Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
You kids off to the dance?,Aren't you coming?
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.,Can we get him to the hospital?
Jesus.,Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?,What's his rent?
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.,Huh?
Take a hike.  Am-scray.,Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
You can't testify.,Why not?
They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.,Yeah, well, that's enough.
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.,So, it is a blacklist.
The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.,Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.,And I won't be a communist anymore.
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.,I'm not sorry for what I said.
Cigarette?,No thanks.
You mean, he was... let go, too?,They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?,I already have.
Would that be Miss Sinclair?,No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.,It's a lovely garden.
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?,Yes, I did.
I was wondering...,Yes?
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?,Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.,Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
How do you like our little hamlet?,I despise it.
San Francisco.,How'd you happen to come here?
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.,What do you mean?
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?,A trifle.
And what had you done?,Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
I don't understand.,Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.,No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
I did.,Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
Yes, I did.,Just listen to them!
Mom, they're in a cage!,They're birds!
Miss Daniels?,Yes?
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.,Well, I suppose...
Is smoking fun?,Oh, I suppose so.
Are you coming to my party?,I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.,Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?,I think they'll be all right, honey.
I wonder if you could help me.,Try my best.
Where does he live?,Right here. Bodega Bay.
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.,Mmmm.
Daniels.,Okay.
Why not, Mrs. Bundy?,Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?,What happened?
One apple pie! You want more coffee?,No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.
A what?,Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
Seven o'clock, same as usual.,I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?,Yes, very.
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.,I know, Mother.
Yes?,I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Tell him about the party.,That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
When do you think they'll come?,I don't know.
Maybe we ought to leave.,Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
Mother, get a rope!,Oh, my God, look at her!
We'll worry about that when we get there.,I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
Where's Mitch?,Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?,Annie's there. She'll be all right.
I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here. ,Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.,I think it might also matter to Mitch.
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.,Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.,Shhhh. Shhhh.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.,Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?,Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
Oh.,I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
I wonder if you could help me.,What?
I understand completely, sir.,As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
No, of course not.,Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.,Aren't these lovebirds?
What did you say?,I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
But how... how do you know my name?,A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
I didn't break that window!,No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...,Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
Why... ,Yes?
What did it say?,None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
Can't see a thing.,I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
Right next to the one you already had.,Look, Mr. Brenner...
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.,How does Mother know what I like to do?
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?,I wrote the letter.
But not for me.,What do you want ?
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.,Cheers.
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?,Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. ,And Fridays? What do you do then?
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.,What'll it say?
Do you want some mustard with this?,No, thank you.
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?,Hear, hear!
It's so damn quiet out there.,It was like that yesterday.
What do you mean?,After the gulls attacked.
Melanie...,...everything I know.
That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while.  Will you be all right here?,Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
The town looks clear.,The bay doesn't.
I keep thinking of Annie. ,It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
Where are they heading?,Inland.
When will they stop?,I thought they'd have stopped by now.
Can we turn back?,I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.,And he'll talk?
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?,Well, all right, but...
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...,No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...,Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by. ,I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
For what purpose?,To...  To kill them.
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.,No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...,Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.,It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... ,Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
Birds?,Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.,That would hardly be possible.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.,Then let's go. Now!
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?,Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.,Can't you please finish your drink?
There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say.,Good.
I'm only a student.,Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
You have his promise, then?,Yes.
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.,Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
You must leave this house.,I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?,Aye.
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.,I've heard of it.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --,Come in, boy -- come in.
I thought only the best students were made assistants.,Well? And are you not a good student?
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?,From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
But you did promise.,Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
Well --,Gray killed her.
We can't be sure of that.,I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --,I can't believe that.
What's that you say?,The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
Where shall we put it? In the back?,No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?,He was a nice horse.
You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?,I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
I'll not do it, Gray.,Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
Toddy hates me.,Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.,That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.,I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?,The heart pumps it.
But what makes a thought start?,In the brain, I tell you. I know.
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --,Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.,I've ordered nothing from you.
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?,Would you bribe me to leave you be?
Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --,But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.,I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.,You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
Check and mate.,Dream on.
I was hoping you'd find out.,Yeah. I sure will.
Where is it? This place?,I think we should get some support?
Fuck! What do you want?,A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.,There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar.",What Scar? What fucking scar?
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.,How can you die if you're already dead?
This is where it happened. Right over here.,Yeah, I know.
Erin. It's not your fault.,It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
It's ok, it's ok...,It's not. I can't take it.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.,Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.,He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.,You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.,You killed my daughter.
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.,I do. Every day.
Anything wrong?,Let's hope not. License and registration please.
But you, you've had them.,Not tonight. Honest.
Are you ok?,What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.,That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
Stay away from me! Stay away!,Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?,Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.,If you mean that you are afraid of us--
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.,I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!,That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
Did you have a nice day, dear?,Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--,Professor Barnhardt.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?,Of course, dear.
Now, Bobby, just a minute--,Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?,Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.,Gee! How could they make a landing?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?,Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
What does that mean?,It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.,Mr. Brady's a cop.
The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs - heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.,And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
I don't believe it.,Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.,Just Klaatu.
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--,Sit down, Mr. Harley.
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.,I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
You know about the United Nations?,We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
I was only hoping to make you understand.,My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.,Thank you... Have you any news?
It was a wonderful day.,You still haven't answered my question.
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.,The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
I will be in just a minute.,The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.,I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
I wonder if we ought to--,Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.,That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.,Is that what you're thinking about?
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!,I'm not going to marry anybody.
Everyone seems so-- ,Jittery is the word.
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.,Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.,May I walk out with you?
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.,Who?
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?,There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
"Klaatu barada nikto.",Remember those words.
Hello.,I -- I thought you were--
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.,This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
You sure about that?,Would you like to sell it?
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.,I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.,In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?,No -- I'm afraid not.
Just passing through Santa Carla?,No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.,You better get some fresh air.
I don't like horror comics.,Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!,We don't ride with vampires.
Death to all vampires!,Maximum body-count.
We still going?,Honda 250, huh?
That's right.,C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
Don't!  Stop!,Why?  They're only noodles.
What's going' on?,What's goin' on, Marko?
What is this, David?,You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
Or a vampire.,Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.,I can't do that!
He's not glowing.,Hit the lights again.
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.,Chill out Edgar.
David.,I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.,Okay, okay.
Ouch, my hair...,When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!,It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
Thanks, Grandpa...,Lots more where he came from.
Hi... I'm Laddie.,This is Michael.
I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.,Who, Laddie?
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.,Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
You didn't tell David?,No.  Just you.
I'll hitch.,Oh, no, you won't.
Okay?,Okay.
When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning?,You've heard this story before?
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.,Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.,Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
What did you say?,Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
Not funny, Sam!,This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
Ohmygod...,Mom!
-- a job.,Do I look that needy?
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?,I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
Max!  What's wrong?,It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
Are you following me?,Well, I...
Hi...,If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?,What do you mean?
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!,Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
Why not?,Because I love you...
Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.,Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
Do I have to do this?,Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.,Wanna go to the comic book store?
I'm making you a sandwich.,Don't bother.
Who are you calling?,The Marines.
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.,Let's load 'em.
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?,Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
What you doin'?,Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
Too damn dangerous.,... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.,Watch Clark.
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.,Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...,What's it going to do, being a plant?
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.,Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
Let's open it.  Now...,Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
You catch anything he was saying?,Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!,It's shorted out or something!
Torch them!!,But...
Well, who says I want you going with me?!,Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
You ain't tying me up.,Then I'll have to kill you.
Load of bullshit.,We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
Maybe we shouldn't.,Then we'll never make it.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!,So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.,Nothing we can do about that.
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.,How far's that?
Right.  Why not?,What's that?
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?,I am going after them.
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.,Damn if I won't.
What's...,Blair.  He's gone berserk.
Somebody definitely messed with it.,We going to make it?
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...,I ain't going with Sanchez.
How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?,Can you think of any other tests?
What if it doesn't come?,It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
This storm do that?,Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.,You crazy?  He might be inside already?
Maybe it ain't coming.,Then we go after him.
You jerking off or just pissed?,We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
Get your gear on.,What for?
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.,So what do you make of it?
We should sleep in shifts.,Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!,Can't hear you.
It must have been hard, leaving your work.,The journey is part of my work.
Now how did you get hurt?,I had an accident.
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?,What else can they do?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.,Where?
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?,How did you know?!
Sir... have you a name?,I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
But you escaped.,I was lucky.  The others weren't.
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.,Can you show us where they live?
Because you'll never die.,Excuse me?
When was his mother taken?,Last night.
No, we created the Morlocks.,Created?
Say I just come back again?,Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
Why?,We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
Now will you go?,No...
I'm tired of running.,Oh, you won't be running for long...
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.,You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
You know, the moment is rather dying here.,Hold on... I know I have it...
I know it's not a diamond but --,A moonstone.
All right...,Not here... alone.  Please.
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.,No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.,It's only a machine.
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.,You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.,How romantic...
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!,Perseverance.
I'm sorry, David.,It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.,For God's Sake, David --
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --,You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --,Hiding?
Good night, David.,Good night, Alex.
This... was my home.,His home.
Is there a lot of illness?,Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
Oh, that explains everything.,I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
How long ago?,More than 800,000 years.
I'm going to sit with Kalen.  Keep the fire burning if you can.,I will...
Yes.,And you saw a shape ahead of you...
This is magnificent...,Thank you.
I don't understand.,I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?,Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.,So you can use it now?
Mara -- what -- ?!,Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.,Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Oh, I'm already swooning.,Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Yes, sir, he --,Tell him to go away --
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?,Exactly correct, sir.
No, sir --,Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
"Eloi"?,What are your people called?
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.,New Yorkers.
I am the oldest.,No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
My father has gone to a better place.,I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
What do you mean?!,They've gone to a better place.
You know that's not true.,We choose to believe it.
My fowl have polluted the yard.,Dean Fulton...
Yes, sir.,Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
How did you get hurt?,Kalen...
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.,I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...,Then don't.
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?,Depends on what you're seeing.
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?,[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
He's recovering on the third floor.,Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.,That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Relax.,Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.,They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
And what's that?,My business?
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.,You sure you know where to find one?
Becker, how do you sleep at night?,You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...,I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
How did you come to know their names?,You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.,No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
Did you know my father?,Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
I thought you said you never knew your father.,I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.,I never touched your father! I swear!
This is really happening, isn't it?,[Beat] What do you need me to do?
I need to get this letter to someone.,I can't take you out of here in your condition...
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.,What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!,Mom, he just fixed our car.
But I like it I guess.,Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.,Well, you belong in one.
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.,I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?,Yes.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.,If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
I might not be able to.,It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
You're sure?,Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
They've got lives to be grateful for.,William, you're not making sense.
Where are we going?,To the hospital.
I've been ok.,Good. How's your mom?
How you doin'?,I'm doing fine.
And if I didn't want to come?,I guess I'd ask you why.
Why, what would you do?,I could try to...make it stop.
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.,You thought my father was crazy?
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...,I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.,Why would we do that?
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?,[Beat] Yeah, it is.
What do you mean?,You have no idea what's going on.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.,Well, what time is it?
And how do you know that?,Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.,I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?,How...how do you know?
Who...who kills me?,You have nothing to fear, William.
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.,Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
[Beat] How do you know?,The Jacket.
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!,So what am I supposed to do?
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?,[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
Well, how'd you get here?,[Beat] I was dropped off.
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...,No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
You want a drink?,Sure.
Well, good for you.,[Beat] Why?
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?,May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
I'm sorry.,Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
Hon?,What?!
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?,In the leg.
Who's the nut?,That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?,You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?,Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!,Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?,It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
I've been better.,You girls are in some hot water.
No!,You want to come on in?
What kind of gun was it?,A .38.
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!,The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
Did you get married real young?,Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?,Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.
Well, I guess I'd better...,Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
You're a bank robber?,Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
What?,Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.,Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
I am funny.  I'm real funny.,Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.,Can't it go to any office?
What?,That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!,Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.
I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you.  It's not that.  I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought.  What do you want, darlin'.  What do you want me to do.,I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?,Oh yeah.
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.,In the back?
Front.,Am I in trouble?
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?,No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
'Cause I didn't ask him.,Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.,Isn't this fun?
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.,Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Oh my God.,Get the car.
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.,Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Did you finish thinking?,I think better when I drive.
I wish we could've brought him with us.,What did Darryl say?
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...,I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!,Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.,I won't wait up.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?,Taking a shower.
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.,Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
Drive!  Drive away!,What happened?
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!,Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
You think you've found your calling?,Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.,Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.,Let's get it over with.
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?,I... I...
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.,Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?,You mean now or before?
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.,About how fast was I going?
I am really sorry about this.,I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
What?,Shoot the radio!
Sorry!,Sorry!
Ready?,Hit it.
I said all that?,No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
He said they're charging us with murder.,Eeuww.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.,We can change our names.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.,You're drivin'.
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!,It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.,Unbearable, I'd imagine.
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?,You sent that?
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.,Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Gay? He said you were gay?,He implied it.
It must be great with a wife like that.,Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
Whatever happened to Mary?,I told you, her family moved to Miami.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?,I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
You're kidding? What did they say?,They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
I don't know about this, Dom.,Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
And you think he could find out her number for me?,He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.,What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Never met him.,Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Mary's a babe!,What?
How the hell did you get here anyway?,Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
And this adversely affects me how...?,Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary!
Got cash.,Car clean? Plenty of gas?
You know, clean the pipes.,Pipes? What are you talking about?
Why's that?,I'm usually too tired to be.
Uh-huh. Where was he?,Out getting coffee.
Mary.,From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?,I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
Who?,Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
Here's the info you asked for.,Thanks.
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.,What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Take it easy, that's Bill.,Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Here, just have one of these then.,Healy, what I just tell you?
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?,No I can't.
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.,Am I?
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.,Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
So where the hell are you, Healy?,Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.,A girl after your own heart, Ted.
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?,Great.
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.,Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...,You're a movie buff?
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.,Have you seen it?
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.,A fucking moron.
Yeah.,Wow. I thought I was the only one.
So...,Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
Turn it up, Magda.,Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
Urrggghh...,Warren!
Are you okay?,Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
You want her dead, don't you?,You can't be serious.
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.,Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.,You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.,Really?  Very, very?
I think your life's about to change.,So you found Mary?
Mary's a little chubby, huh?,I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
Nope. Never been.,Huh?
Uh, that's okay.,You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy!
Jai alai?,Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.,Good good.
But you said she was a sparkplug...?,I said buttplug. She's heinous.
All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out.  The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.,It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.,Your turn?
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?,I don't know what you're talking about.
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.,Same here.
You bet.,Did you study under Kim Greene?
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?,Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.,I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.,Maybe this'll jog your memory.
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?,Who?
You what?,You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.,Bullshit!
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.,Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?,I never said that.
You little fuck.,What?
Thanks for picking me up.,No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
Oh. Well I am.,Hm?
I'd go with the seven.,Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
How do you guarantee that?,Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.,But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.,All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.,Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.,That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
I don't watch the new ones.,This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
Bundt cake?,Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.,Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?,I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
Pat's an architect, too.,Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Pat does projects all over the world.,Where would I have seen your work?
You don't think they're too big?,No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.,I appreciate you looking out for me.
Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.,You mean he's not a criminal?
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?,No, it's an old football injury.
So who you taking to the prom?,Huh?
And did everything -- ?,Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.
Oh. So... what brings you down here?,Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?,Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.,Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
Sure.,Oh great, I ran out.
Now by killer, you mean...?,I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.,I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.,I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.,Yeah?
So you're a writer?,Trying to be.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.,We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
Why not?,Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.,Yeah, sure.
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?,Toy poodle!
Get out.,Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
I, uh... I got it stuck.,You got what stuck?
It.,It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!,Shhhhhh!
One guess.,How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
No, no, please!,Teddy, be brave.
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.,What are you doing?
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.,What --
Starshells.,Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
Well, I'm not.,Then you'll call, right?
The other thing is...,...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
Zorin will eat him alive!,Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
Oh, still sore about this.,Something your father would've come up with.
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.,What does the letter say?
Slow down. Smell that?,Smoke.
Yeah?,Kenny. It's over.
Max.,McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option.  The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316.,An invasion...
Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.,Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.,No. I'm glad I'm home.
So what've we got today?,Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
Still think Cuba isn't important?,Not as far as the election goes.
No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.,There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
Let's get out of here.,Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?,You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.,I don't know. I don't know.
He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.,And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.,Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
Hello?,I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.,And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.,And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...,Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.,Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
Bob. Bet you had a late night.,Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.,Rug samples.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?,Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
Mr. Clear Moon.,Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.,Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.,FBI? What you investigatin'?
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --,-- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?
Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?,It ain't Geronimo.
Who are you?,I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you?,I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --,-- did you understand me when I said that --
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.,Seven.
Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?,You crashed my file?
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.,I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?,Beats the hell outta me.
No. That's Ray here. Ray...,Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
I got one up on ya.,Go ahead.
Who is he?,One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
What'd she say?,She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.,Let's see it.
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.,Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.,When did we get that?
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --,-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
Tread matches. It's the car.,Yes.
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!,Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --,-- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.,His spiritual mother...
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.,Let's go.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.,Medicine. As in medicine man?
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.,He knows me?
The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?,He also said "listen to the water."
The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?,Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
It's not real.,What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?,No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.,Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.,Well, it was just a dream, I --
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?,Yeah. Fitful dreams.
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.,So they took care of Leo.
He's gone.,He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?,We're going for The Stronghold.
Who did?,You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.,I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray.
Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is.,Move it, Magdelana.
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...,-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
I desecrated it?,You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.,Good.
Do you want a coffee?,No. No, no. Thank you.
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?,Leavenworth a tough joint?
You ever try solitary confinement?,No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!,I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...,All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more.
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.,It's not that.
That's a big comfort to me.,I could be, too.
Yeah, most likely.,Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
I thought he'd never leave.,Yeow!
Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.,Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
If you were directly above him, how did you see him?,I was inverted.
It never came up.,You let me make a fool of myself.
There you go with those moves again.,Too aggressive?
Yes. I'll give you that!,Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
Lieutenant...,Evan... or Maverick.
How about what?,How about anything, anything you want to do.
Why'd you do that?,
No!,It's not suffering anymore.
Does it bother you?,They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.,You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.,Are you really that brave?
You want to go ballistic?,I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.,Why?
Well no...inverse order.,I'm still second best.
Just good luck.,Where'd you get it.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?,He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
What do you do when you come here?,I sit. I think. I play games.
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?,What truth?
You weren't gonna say goodbye?,I was, later.
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.,I hope you find him.
Well... What   is   it?,Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Yes sir. I do, Sir.,Well?
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?,F-14's sir.
Can't shake him.,WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...,NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
Let's hope you're right!,What is he doing?
That's missile lock!,He better be kidding!
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.,You.
This is crazy!,What is?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!,What?  What is it?
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!,We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
I'm pulling up.,No! Now we're inverted!
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!,Not anymore.
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.,Okay.
Gotta go, man.,280, 290, 300 knots.
You're not supposed to...,But I have to!
Let me do the talking.,Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
So I've heard.,Who's your pilot?
Tom Kazansky.,No shit. The Iceman....
How was it?,Could use a dash more jet fuel.
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.,Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.,Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?,Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.
We did it!,Look, Ma, top of the world!
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!,Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
What the hell is this?,Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!,Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
That's Kazanski.,No shit! That why they call him Ice?
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.,Don't.
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.,That's because you don't have any women.
Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.,I didn't ruin her.
COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.,STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
You saved our lives. You did it!,We did it.
Who is the best.,Nope.
Need a hint?,I think I can work it out on my own.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.,Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
He's a good pilot.,I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..,Yes sir.
Why?,We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.,Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
For the same reason you are.,Oh, you mean the thrill!
How do you feel?,All right.
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.,My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
I called your house.,My wife's house.
Where's yours?,Over there man.
So, where to?,The Last Resort.
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?,Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.,Hey, I got four kids to feed.
What do you want?,They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
Would you like the same suite?,Definitely.
The guy's a fucking asshole.,Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.,We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?,No, sir.
He had help.  From our side, sir.,I know that.
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.,Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Blonde, brunette, redhead?,Brunette.
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.,Sleazy...and demure.
I'm listening.,I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.,Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Suppose I do...then what?,Swallow this.
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.,Relax, you'll live longer.
You're Kuato, right?,Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
I don't know.  Maybe.,Well don't.
No shit...,Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
What trip?,You went to Rekall, remember?
Harry, what the hell is this?,Come on, let's go have that drink.
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.,Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Where?,Up to the right.
I want that fucker dead.,I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Are you saying she liked it?,I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.,I've got Quaid.
Where is he?,Level 2.  Galleria.
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.,I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
He's not at ground level.,Up!
Look at this shit.,What the hell is this?
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?,Drive!  DRIVE!!
Would you please repeat the destination?,Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
The fare is eighteen credits, please.,Quit while you're ahead.
Who?,The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Who is she?,Nobody.
Lori...,Yeah, sweetheart?
The hell you're not.,I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?,Beats me.  I just work here.
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...,Mars.
Right.  Mars.,That a problem?
Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.,What's in the two week package?
Secret agent...How much is that?,Aaah, let me tantalize you.  You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission.  People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman...
I love you.,I love you.
I think you better leave.,Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
Now what?,Jump!
He's lying.,You two-faced-bastard.
What reactor?!,The one in the mine!
You guys all set?,Ready as we'll ever be.
Yeah, like they got a plan...,Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...,You can't fight'em that way...
What do you think?  Max firepower or...?,I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.,Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.,Nope, there!  That's one.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.,Howdy, Rhonda.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.,Hell you did.  Your turn.
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.,Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.,Has a lot of rain.
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.,Why?
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!,Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.,Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
What the hell are they?,Sons of bitches!
This is one big mother!,So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
Well, folks, what's the plan?,First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
You go north, I'll go south.,Right.
You're right, don't matter where they come from.,Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!,We got a plan!
Watch your ass, shithead.,Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.,I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...,Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
What the hell are you doing?!!,I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
Road's in!,Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
We playing cards tonight?,I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
The con...!  Oh my God.,Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
You sure this is where it was?,Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
And I appreciate it.,You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.,They're working together, too.
I brought it... to the coroner.,An hour after you picked it up!
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?,Correct.
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!,Sustained.
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !,Complain to the Bar Commission.
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.,I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
Look, I'm a lawyer and --,-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --,Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
What, "everything"? You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit about that -- !,Let's snuff this lowlife!
Haven't heard that one before, Ed.  But I guess I'll be hearing it again.,Not necessarily...
Oh really?,It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
-- an angel dust dealer --,I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
Where?,Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?,With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
Some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists. The mayor pressures the cops. The cops pressure the rival gang -- the Joe Boys. The Joes give up Shu Kai Kim -- the schmuck kid from Korea who's been pestering 'em to get in.,You really think that's what happened?
Eddie... What's a DD-5?,A Complaint Follow-Up form.
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man.","Cecil Stipe"? Have we seen any affadavit with that name?
Eddie Dowd.,Roger Baron.
Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?,1530 Rivington Street.
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!,That's why I hate experts.
Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!,Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!,What's Art Esparza?
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!,You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
-- What?,I've seen this picture before.
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.,Christ... Shu is innocent.
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!,Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
Murder witness.,You're doing a murder case?
Stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward, Kitty. Y'oughta start looking for the others...,Eddie, I'm not working on this case. You boys have fun.
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.,But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.,Screw you too, Kitty.
Figures.,Want to tell me what went down here?
-- How could I help you?,By trusting me. Shit, man...
...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer?  You left your telephone number?,Y-yes, sir.
Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?,Shu Kai Kim.
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?,What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?,Badgering.
To the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests?,Objection.
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!,The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
Yes, Mr. Dowd.,Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.,I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
No.,No? Then what did he say?
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?,-- What trial?
I followed you here from court.,I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.,For control of the prison drug trade?
Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?,Yeah, we do some of that.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?,A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?,Shu's the only one I know of...
You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...,Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
I think what Eddie wants to say is --,No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
CIA?,Telephone.  I suppose you don't know the phone company killed Kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they'll never let that happen. They control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end, and --
You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?,Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?,She is preparing a great abundance of food.
No... No, go away.,I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?,NO! GOD, NO...
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?,Get lost Bobby.
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.,What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?,Yep, it sure is.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.,More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.,Was there an argument?
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.,That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
Is there a golf course around here?,Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.,That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.,ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?,I'm up to speed, Stanley.
Where is the ring?,Someone else has it now.
Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?,How come Jack let's you work here?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.,Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?,I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
Oh, the uncle is missing.,Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?,We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
Take a look at this.,She's wearing a ring.
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.,May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.,Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.,You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.,I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Oh god, Laura.,Well, why not?
Call me.,Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Do you want to talk?,No, I want to smoke.
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?,Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?,If I can smoke it.
Where are you going?,No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?,Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.,Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?,No, you should forget about last night.
You're not mad at me?,No.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?,I can't help you there.
But I love you, Laura.,And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
What'll it be?,Fill 'er up.
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.,But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.,I'm not.
Why? It does.,No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
It does matter. We're in love.,James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.,You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
Oh, Laura.,"Oh, Laura..."
Bobby killed a guy.,What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
You want to see...,See what?
Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?,Boating?
Josie, I think we should go public.,That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.,Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.,I understand.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.,I'm sorry, Mom.
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.,Mom, take it easy.
I hate asparagus.,Sure you do, it's good for you.
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?,Not really.
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.,Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
Are you sure you're okay?,Yes.
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".,Oh, Leland.
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.,Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
I don't know.,That's right.
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.,As if I didn't know.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?,She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?,As far as we know, nothing.
What are you doing here?,Mickey told me to come back to work.
...he wants to testify...?,It looks that way.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?,It's a crime.
You would not...?,No.
They lied.,'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
I do. Yes.,You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?,Just as you are, Sir...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?,No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.,Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine.
I did.,Objection.
Ed Concannon.,Frank Galvin. We've met before.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...,...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Objection!,And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Mr. Concannon...?,Nothing further, your Honor.
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...,I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?,Yes.
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.,That's right.
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?,My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.,...that's all right.
It's all right, Mickey.,You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...,What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.,You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...,That's what I'd planned to...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...,From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?,Well...
I am on the staff of...,Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
I read the hospital report on your client.,...Deborah Ann Kaye...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...,...and you're going to do that?
Do you know who her doctors were?,I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of...,What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party...?  Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge...
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.,How old is he?
Thank you.,You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?,Yes.
Yessir. I'm sorry.,Why is that?
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?,My client can't walk, your Honor.
I had a witness disappear on me.,That happens.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?,If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Really. How wonderful for you.,Yes. It was, actually.
What happened...?,They, uh, they got to my witness.
I've got to work...,Do you want me to go...?
Why don't you get some rest?,I've got to work.
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...,You're going to stay here...?
Well, then what are you doing here?,I... do you want me to leave?
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.,Who told you that?
Maybe I'll tell you later.,Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...,If I don't 'grow up...'
Pardon?,Kathy Price.
We find that your subscription lapsed...,My subscription lapsed three years ago...
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...,No. At Chelsea Childcare. Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey? I'm late for work.
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.,And ask me what?
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.,A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.,I'm going to see you get that chance.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...,He's not in, Sir.
Uh...,Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...',I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
...I have to stand up for her...,Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
Who have we got?,We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.,Admittance form is wrong.
So what?,So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.,So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.,Oh shit, what's today?
What happened, Joey...?,I can't talk now.
How are you holding up?,I'm swell.
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?,You use their witness.
That's right.,I think we tried that. The case is over.
What are you doing in New York...?,Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.  The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.  She wanted to move to Boston.  How badly did she hurt us, Joe?,I don't know.
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.,I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
What?,You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
...of the procedures...,Yes, the roving nurse...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...,As I've said we had some more...
What happened in those three minutes...?,We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...,Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Yes.,Huh. And why is that?
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.,How'm I doing so far?
Hey, there - open up!,Come on out!  We're friends!
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...,All right - I've seen enough!
There's nobody left around here now.,We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
Did it do you any good?,Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
They've all stopped at the same time.,There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
How does it happen cars are running?,Automobile ignitions are insulated.
The troops are certainly moving in here!,Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.,You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.,Would you like some coffee, General?
Where are we?,Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.,Don't you live at home?
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.,I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.,I liked him.
That's what knocked the phones out, too.,How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!,So is the town, I notice!
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.,I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.,Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.,Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
The nightmares.,He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
You mean that was a...,Sort of a trial balloon.
So I don't know about horror.,Come on.  Kids love horror.
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?,Yes, but...
One of mom's cups got broken.,I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
No, you don't.,Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
What if it isn't over?,Maybe you should tell me your dream.
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.,You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?,No...
Does he have to stay here over night?,Absolutely.
Like what?,Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
You going away?,Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
Rex saved me.,Rex?  Who's Rex?
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe.",They were safe and could sleep.
He's on his way.,He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!,You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
You okay, champ?,Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?,Right 'cross the freeway.
In what, a romantic comedy?,Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
I've never mentioned it to him.,Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?,John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
You're right.  That sounds crazy!,John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
Fred Krueger did it.,Yeah, sure.
Heather, what is it?,Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.,What's that?
Like the Genie in the bottle.,Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
Me?  Why me?,Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.,He knows.
You may not like what you hear.,I can take it.
Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!,Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
Why didn't you drop any sail?,Skipper called us out of the rigging.
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.,Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!,It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
Make us proud.,Yes sir.
Why don't you go and try some of that on?,Okay.
Fine.,All right.  I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
Albatross?,Yeah.
You okay?,Yeah.  How'd you do.
You only hurt yourself you know?,Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.,I know enough.
But that's not the point...,That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
How ya doing?,Fine.
Ya know... "It".,That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
So... What happened?,My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
It works?,Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
What are they doing?,I can't make it out?
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.,Yes sir.
Northeast sir!,Unfurl the squares!
The Dolphin was a symptom.,Of what?
Of a fight he can't win out here.,It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
Chicken is a fool's game captain.,So is violating international law.
But you invited is aboard.,Your cannons made a compelling argument.
Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?,I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.,Twice.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.,Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.,Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.,As you can see, there's a lot to do.
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.,He's a big boy.
Spying?!,I can take care of myself.
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.,Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.,That's enough.
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.,Shut up donut.
If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.,Like you'd know what to do with one.
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.,Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
Tie it off!!,Outer.
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.,It hurts too much to care.
I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there.,Joy, rapture...
Swing up, son.,What?
What are you blubbering about?,I don't know...
Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.,I can't.
Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.,He climbed when he was ready.
Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew.,Yes, I was.
There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.,I understand.
Easy for you to say.,What's that supposed to mean?!
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.,Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.,I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.,Get out.
How 'bout a beer?,That'd be fine, Bobby.
Thought you said this was a private club. How come I'm allowed in without bein' a member?,You black?
No.,You an indian?
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.,What's that?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.,She really say she was pregnant?
What is it?,Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
Mostly black though in that boogie place.,What's the name of it?
So, it's back to the islands.,Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.,We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
What happened on the charges?,Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.
But I'm wild at heart.,If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?,Why not? How was the fishin'?
Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.,This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.,Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?,Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.,Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
Who was that?... Who know's your here?,I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.,That bastard Pucinski...
Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.,How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.,Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
What brand'd she smoke?,Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.,Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
You're perfect for me, too.,You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
In a fire, as I recall.,Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.,Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?,I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.,'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.,That's good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.,That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
Actin' funny how?,Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.,Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.,What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
That don't smell like a More.,It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.,What kinda trash talk is that?
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.,Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?,Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.,Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.,We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
What's that, peanut?,One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?,Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.,Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
Who do?,You do.
You think he saw us?,Who knows, baby?
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.,Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.,It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?,Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...,Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
How'd you know my daddy?,Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos...,...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
Oh God, Sailor.,One bad car accident...
Sailor, what are we gonna do?,I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?,That smell's still fillin' this room good.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.,And Bobby too, I hear...
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.,Oughta make 'em happy.
Let's leave here.,We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.,I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
You must be my son.,Shake hands with your daddy.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.,Lead the way.
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!,Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.,No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.,Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Six.,Got any plans?
Really, mama, I gotta go.,What if I asked you not to?
Wouldn't make any difference.,What if I told you not to?
Have it your way... But you want it.,Lula's gone off with Sailor.
Get rid of him?,Yes... Get rid of him.
Shoot him? Like with a gun?,Yes.
Through the forehead?,Yes.
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?,Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
Where we goin'?,Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.,You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.,That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.,Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?,The candelabras were my Gran's.
You all right, Professor Tripp?,He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
You snore.,So I hear.
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.,Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
You're stoned.,She's still a transvestite.
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.,Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
Is that just beer?,Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
I'm sure. Where is everyone?,Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
He's a boxer. A flyweight.,Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
Sometimes we have to improvise.,Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
Kidnapped? By who?,His parents.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?,Maybe... I don't know.
So whose car is it?,My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...,...we find the jacket.
Kind of a sign, you're saying.,In a sense.
You peeked, didn't you?,I peeked.
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.,Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
I passed out.,You did.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?,How long have you been having them?
Is that in my chart?,I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
Vernon.,Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Who's got a gun?,You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
Hello?,Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.,Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...,You're in Kinship?
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...,Heaven?
They're glass. The buttons.,Like the lady herself.
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.,Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.,No thanks. I'm fine without them.
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.,I put you on the floor.
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.,I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Yes.,Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
Professor Tripp?,Hm.
It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.,But James. I mean... How long?
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.,Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
So, why did you take me up there?,I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
You're lying.,The hell I am.
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.,Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.,Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?,Okay.
Near Carvel?,I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
Professor Tripp...?,Yes, James.
So what are you going to do?,Do?
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?,I would if I knew where I was taking him.
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.,He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.,Who does?
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?,I told you, Sewickly Heights.
It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.,Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'
I got the message you called.,I got the message you called too.
Who's gun is that?,It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
Pow.,You got me.
Are you limping? Why are you limping?,Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
And the jacket?,Over there. In the backseat of the...
Someone stole my car.,Grady.
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.,Are you sure you parked it there?
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.,I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
I'm through improvising.,Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
Ouch. How many?,Dozens. It's very sad.
Does he still love you?,It didn't come up.
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.,Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.,That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
Grady?,GRADY Tripp. English Department.
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?,I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
No.,Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.,Sick.
Hardapple?,I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
George Sanders?,Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know...  He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?,I haven't heard of half of those.
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...,You want to keep him happy.
Don't need to think fast to handle beer.,Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
Foreman now.,No shit.
Five years.,Beautiful. How's business?
I'll never forget you got me started there.,I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
I was just thinking of... the noise.,I like the noise.
I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.,How is she?
Annette? She's good... tense.,When can I see her?
I don't know. She won't talk about it.,You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.,How old is Anna?
Cherry.,Huh?
Fucking Mariners.,Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
What party?,The birthday party.
C'mon, Walter.,You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
There's a million birds here.,In that birch tree is a nest.
You always carry these?,When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
It's just a city park.,You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.,I'm not pretty.
What does that mean?,It means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.
I would.,Got something to hide?
Cherry?,Yeah.
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.,They grow outside, don't they?
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?,I fell asleep.
You walked home.,Yes.
This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV. She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  Ten days later they find Adele's body. Or what's left of it.  You believe in fairy tales?,Fairy tales?
The one with the ax?,I don't know.
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?,No.
I wasn't feeling well.,I could take you downtown.
What's with the boxes?,You're a cop. Figure it out.
And your new apartment?,Apartment's okay.
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?,You are in.
Yeah, like the bird.,Can I ask how old you are?
No.,How come?
What's her name?,Ms. Kramer.
Walter?,Yes?
No.,I don't mind.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.,What?
That's right.,No way.
It was just an idea.,Bad idea.
That's right.,You think reflection is good.
It's very good, indeed.,How's that?
How long is this going to take?,We have a few more minutes.
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?,They usually tell me.
Fuck you, Rosen!,I know --
You don't know!,I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.,Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
That's not a helpful answer.,That's my answer.
Close your eyes.,What?
What the hell are you doing there?,Did you and your sister often take naps together?
I don't like nobody behind my back!,I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?,This is garbage!
Did you get an erection?,I was six years old!
What?,Are you okay?
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?,People without cars.
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.,What?
I'm not easily shocked.,I get that impression.
Hey, that was... intense.,You're still here.
No you're not.,Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
Tell me about it.,Maybe later.
I thought I'd stay the night.,What for?
Is that all?,When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
Hey, there.,Hi.
Molested little girls?,Yeah.
Why don't you just go now, okay?,I told you I'm not easily shocked.
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?,What?
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?,No. Never again.
You mean the time you're locked away?,No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.,Sounds like a special guy.
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...,Their power. They seduce me.
Most people say the odds are against me.,What odds?
I love my brothers.,No you don't.
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.,You never asked them about it?
What's this?,What's it look like?
I don't need a plant.,Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
I didn't sleep well.,Do you want to talk about it?
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.,Piece of cake, baby.
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.,Where're you?
Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--,There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.,We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
Okay, good reason.  Then what?,It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.,Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--,Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
Nice shot, Lins.,What is that?  You drop your dive light?
What's goin' on, Boss?,Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?,Yeah, okay.  Okay.
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?,Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
I can't believe you let them do this!,Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.,Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
I think you were worried about me.,That must be it.
What are you still wearing that for?,I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
What happened?,Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.,You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
What's the scoop, ace?,I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.,I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
He's got the shakes?,Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.,Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Son of a bitch!,Calm down, Bud.
Alright, put this on.,What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--,NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
No, Bud, no... not you.,Who then?
Did you find Wilhite?,No.
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.,You watch yourself.
Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.,Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
Quiet!  Quiet!,Turn it up, bozo.
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.,I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...,That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.,Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
Getting a reading?,It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!,What's the timer set for?
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.,Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
Would we see the flash?,Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
When do you have to go back?,I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
Then how come you're not with him?,What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...,What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
How are you?,Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
Claudia, aren't you coming?,I'm certainly not going to swim across.
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.,But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?,At what?
Well?,Well, what?
How wonderful!,That's Patrizia's way of letting us know she's with us.
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.,More so than the shark?
Does it please you to say such things?,Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
What are you saying?,I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
I love you.,Tell me once more.
I don't love you.,I deserve it.
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?,One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.,Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
I'm not coming.,But then why did you bother changing?
Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.,Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.,But why all nudes?
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?,He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
Looks like the weather is changing.,Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.
Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.,Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?,Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.,And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.,But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...,And do you remember where she got off?
Whose boat is that?,What boat?
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?,At this time of the year there are so many boats...
Your mother?,Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?,I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.,Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
Zuria?,Yes. Until proven otherwise.
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.,Is that far from here?
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?,Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.
No.,Through someone else?
I can't say.,Why?
She'd punish me.,One of the other Sisters?
I am, there's too much flesh on me.,Agnes...
Look at the statues, they're thin.,Agnes...
But she watches... she listens.,Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
I'm not hungry.,You've got to eat something Agnes.
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?,Yes Mother.
Why?,In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.,Yes, Mother.
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.,It's not that... it's not that...
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?,Yes.
He's told you?,No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
I don't know.,Do you remember the night they said it came?
Yes.,Where did the baby come from?
From their heads...,Is that where they say it came from... ?
From God.,After God... before the waste-paper basket.
Anything?,Anything.
Are you married?,No.
Would you like to be?,Not at the moment, no.
Why not?,I've stopped menstruating
No questions.,Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
One.,What?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?,Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?,I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?,No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
Why not?,Because I don't want one.
Is that what she said?,If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...,Not my fault.
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.,I'm not sick.
She's dead isn't she?,Yes.
Yes?,... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
She tells you you're ugly?,Yes.
Why?,Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
How does she know that?,Her headaches.
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?,I'm afraid.
You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.,Yes.
Of telling you.,But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
How did you have a baby?,It came out of me.
Did you know what was going to come out?,Yes.
Why?,May I open my eyes now?
What made it grow?  Do you know?,Yes.
Will she be angry?,She made me promise not to.
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.,I'm afraid.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?,Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
Yes.,What do you feel?
Who?,Go away, I don't want you here.
Are you frightened?,Yes.
Stay away from me...,Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
I hate him...,Of course you do. Who was it?
She took the baby in her arms?,Yes.
H... how?,I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.
Look into the convent records.,Sister...
The bishop is breathing down our necks.,And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
Something they... that they overlooked.,What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
I don't know.,You got to be crazy.
Thanks. ,If I find anything I'll call you.
Martha, it's you.,What about Roger? He's free.
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.,Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.,Not any more... now I like chocolate.
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.,Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
And you had a sister who died in the convent.,Who told you this?
Do you still go to church?,What business is it of yours..?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.,Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
You can call me Sister.,... Thank you.
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?,No-one.
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...,The science of psychiatry.
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.,I am not with the Inquisition.
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.,That's ridiculous...
That's absurd!,That possibility never occurred to you?
I was appalled, just as you are now.,And what happened?
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.,But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
I am...,No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
How?,Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
There's nothing here.,Was the child full term?
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?,I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
Do you know what she did to her?,I don't think I care to know.
Because I am a moral person.,Bullshit!
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.,And what has that to do with it?
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.,So you left the Church because you had freckles?
Would you like one?  Huh?,I'd love one.
Even Christ would partake socially.,Saint Peter?
Pipe!,Right...
For Agnes.,You think she's a saint?
She's been touched by God, yes.,How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
The father!,Who is he?
Why must he be anybody?,My God, you're as crazy as...
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.,That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?,If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.,I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
And the baby.,No!
The usual ten per cent?,Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.,Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Oh don't be so stroppy!,Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
Nine.,Bet you're only eight and a half.
I bet you're  -- sixteen!,Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.,Y'what?
I'm a deserter.,Are you now?
Yeah, I've blown school out.,Just you?
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.,Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
Sure.,And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
You don't think...,They'll be here.
I'm afraid I don't understand.,Oh, my God, he's a natural.
Now, you'll like these. You really "dig" them. They're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles.,I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.,Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Get him out of here!!,Have I said something amiss?
That's not your Grandfather.,It is, y'know.
Gerron.,No, straight up.
What's up?,He's sulking again.
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.,You crawler.
Should I say it?,Follow your impulse.
No, I didn't you did ...,Well, what happened?
Sorry.,Eh, there's only three of them.
Oh!,Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
Are you supposed to be here?,I've got you worried, haven't I?
Oh, it's the way you talk.,Is it ... is it, really?
I see.  Do you like the play?,Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Thank you.,Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...,I'm not ...
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?,Yes.
I bet you don't sound like real people.,We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.,And cunning.
Parading's better!,Parading?
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.,What's that mean?
And what's it all come to in the end?,Yeah ... what's in it for me?
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.,Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
What are you doing?,Lip reading.
Come on let's get this coffee.,Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.,Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... 
You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.,But I'm clean.
And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!,Don't dramatise.
Yeah ... so what?,Why do you always use your left hand?
No, that's his other one.,That's all right then.
Aye, he looks a right lurker.,You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?,What little old man?
How d'you reckon that one out?,Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Gie's a kiss!,Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.,Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.,He started it.
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?,Of course, he's concealed about me person.
No.,Ah, go on, you swine.
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.,Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.,Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.,Sit down, the lot of you.
Hello.,Hello.
He's betrayed the class.,Oh, leave off!!!
And?,Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.,Y'what?
Do I have to raise me voice?,Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
Yeah, down the ... er ...,Well, give a couple of minutes ...
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.,But John hasn't got any.
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?,Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.,You were twanging too loud.
So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.,Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
Oh... God... am I cold...,Is that you, Roby?
I don't recognize that constellation.,Dell, plot our location.
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.,Is it solid?
It's... basalt.  Rock.,Then take her down.
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.,Looks like a derelict.
This is Chaz.,Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
What is it?,Take a look.
Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?,The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
Yes?  What is it?,Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
Why, what's wrong?,The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
You know what they make this stuff out of?,Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Where does that go?,All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
What the hell's going on?,Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Hurt!  How?,Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?,Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out.,Poison gas...
God, that smoke's poisonous!,It's eating a hole in the floor!
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.,You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
There.  Should be coming through about there.,Careful, don't get under it!
No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping.,Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.,Good.
I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock.,Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change.
While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.,Sounds like a rough one.
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.,Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.,Let me go first; you stay behind me.
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.,No.
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.,We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.,I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
What common objects?,Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.,You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.,I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
What's wrong?,My signal's fading.
Oh God, oh God no.,Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship.,Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
And what do we do when we find it?,We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.
That's the one about the albatross, right?,We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...,That tube must be depositing it in him.
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?,About four hours.
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.,Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Martin?,I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
Still worried?,Oh well... you know me.
What would you say that was supposed to mean?,Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
Hey, can you guys hear me?,Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --,Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
Here, Chaz.,We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.,Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
We can't leave him out here, open the door.,Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!,Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?,Let's be democratic.
This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.,Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
<u>Hey watch it</u>!,It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?,Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
Headache?  Dehydration?,The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
What is it?,It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.,Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
It's a rhino.,Is it dead?
Nice howitzer you've got there.,Thanks.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?,Okay, give me the numbers.
Where is she?,Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
I found it...,And?
Where're they headed?,We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
What's going on?,The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place.,What's our weapons situation?
De Vries?,Yeah?
Something spooking the rhinos?,I dunno.
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.,Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?,I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
Alright, okay.  Look...,What?
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!,It's alright, it's cool...
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.,Where does that lead to?
We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.,How tight are these shafts?
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?,Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.,You've checked that end?
There's still time to back-out.,Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
Okay, I'm out of here!,Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
Any luck raising Ackland's party?,Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.,'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
I've found Ackland!,Hold on...
Phoebe?,I call myself Phoebe.
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...,Please do.
It needn't be.,Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?,The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I-,- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.,Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
We never met. That's why.,Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?,Margo.
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?,Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...,Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.,Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
Naturally enough, your understudy.,I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
Just slipped your mind.,Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...,How nice.
Bill...,The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Bill!,Huh?
I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...,Maybe just a little around the edges.
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-,Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
I told her. I sounded off.,All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-,I'll try.
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-,Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?,As of this moment you're six years old...
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-,Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...,Sing it?
I'll check with Eve...,What?
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!,You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-,- guilty.
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...,I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl...
Addison-!,So full of meaning, fire and music!
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!,I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
Paranoiac!,I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
No, I'll tell it to you! For the last time, I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!,That word again! I don't even know what it means...
Don't be condescending.,Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.,You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.,Glory Hallelujah.
It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...,I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
Never try to outguess Margo.,Groom.
Why what?,Why you have to go out there.
I don't have to. I want to.,Is it the money?
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.,You shouldn't have had any doubts.
- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.,Is that what you want me to be?
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...,What did you expect - live sables?
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-,They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
The same size?,Of course!
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.,Well?
Birdie-,Hmm?
She's loyal and efficient-,Like an agent with one client.
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?,You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.,That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
What are you doing here?,I - I guess I fell asleep.
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!,How did you get in here?
That's all.,What for?
It was for my report.,What report? To whom?
How long does it take?,With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-,But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
I thought you'd forgotten about me.,Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
May I have your coat?,Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
I don't expect you to be pleasant.,I don't intend to be.
Oh, but there is-,- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-,Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...,I'll never get over it.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?,It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
Addison wants me to play it.,Over my dead body...
No, thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.,Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
How'd hear about it?,There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?,Not at all...
Did you see it here in New York?,San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East.
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?,There's the script to go back to the Guild-
That's my job.  See you at tea time...,Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
If you'd like.,I wouldn't like.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?,Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.,I had no idea you knew each other.
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...,It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
She's just outside the door.,The heave-ho.
Margo, really...,Please don't play governess, Karen, I haven't your unyielding good taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter...  I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR should I say "ain't I"?
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.,Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.
Not to you. Not to Bill.,Isn't that what they always say?
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!,Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...
With tears?,With tears.
It's going to be a cozy weekend.,What is?
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...,Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...
Lloyd, be careful...,Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...,I'm beginning to catch up.
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...,Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!,The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-,I'm a human being, I've got some!
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.,I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...,Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
She's your understudy.,Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...,Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.,The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
I don't think I could be.,Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.,What's your being married got to do with it?
Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?,Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...,I don't know if this would be a wise move...
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--,--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
Maybe a political operative of some sort--,--a spy, you mean?
See her?  Get anything?,For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.,It's safe, try it, you'll see.
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.,You want me to be the bastard.
--I know a lawyer at Justice--,--has he got an ax?--
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--,--Haldeman I know, who else?
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?,The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
What's the matter?,Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. ,--We got twenty minutes to deadline--
Woodward?,Hmm?
--jeeeeeeesus--,--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
--jeeeeeeeeesus--,--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
I'll never get out of here in time.,The telephone calls... we know about that.
The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--,--yeah, that was in The Times this morning.
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?,This?  Naw...
But you know who did.,When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.,And?--
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--,--there's nothing new in it--
Five hundred; six maybe.,You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.,Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
--you don't really think you're being followed?,This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
FBI too?,You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
You've really got to go.,Just let me get a match.
But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.,All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
Just tell me about the goddamn article.,It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
Who by?,A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--,--they're worse. That's why I quit.
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.,Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
I really can't talk now--,--this'll only take one second--
What's this?,My non-denial denial.
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.,Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.  You're certain on Mitchell?,He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
--I saw him. He verifies.,OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
I got Clawsen on hold--,--his dialing finger must be falling off--
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.,Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.,So?
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.,A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--,--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?,I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.,If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?,John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.,Who?--be specific. How high up?
You'll have to find that out, won't you.,The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?,I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--,--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and...  Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt?  He is?,Howard Hunt here.
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?,Good God!
But it's possible.,It is.
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?,Nobody ever had too much.
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--,--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?,You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
...go on, go on...,That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.,I did all right on McCord.
--who you got?--,--well, Sloan--
Howard--,--remember Toronto, Harry.
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--,--go over your sources again--
More denunciations?,One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
What else have you got?,According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?,Absolutely.
--no--,--can we use their names?--
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?,I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--,--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?,No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?,When so ordered.
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.,The what to what?
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!,Sorry, coach.
What did you just say?,Suck me...beautiful?
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.,I'm not good in math.
This is your plan, Finch?,Yep.
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...,Seduce her.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.,You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
What's your middle name?,Forget it.
So you're going to Michigan?,Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?,Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
I know.  Salt and pepper?,Sure.
So we're gonna be close next year?,You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
What about the game?!,I'm not playing.
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.,What's that?
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!,I know, it sucks!
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.,Yeah right.
...I've never tried it.,Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.,Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
No comment.,No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
You're so big!,Yeah, that's right.
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.,No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.,No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Did I miss anything?!,Just in time.
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.,Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
Please, God.  Let this be it.,He's going in!
How do you know that?,She's already on a plane back home.
Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?,My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
Yes.,That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
What was your name again?,Michelle.
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?,Highly, highly overrated.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.,Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!,I told you.
This'll do.,Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --,Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?,Don't you want me to?
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.,Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.,After getting laid?
Jim...,Oh no.
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!,God dammit, Stifler!
Oh...ungghhhhh!,Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
You're not doing the extra credit problems.,No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
I think you're so right, Kevin.,You want to do it?
Kevin?  Do you not love me?,No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
About the other day...I've been thinking.,So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
You sure you're comfortable?,Yeah.  Are you sure?
Yeah.,Me too.
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.,Okay.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.,I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
What?,Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
Have you ever heard of the bible?,What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?,Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
Then she said -- she loves me.,Oh shit dude, the L-word!
You ever hear of something called The Bible?,Once, in church, dude.
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.,You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?,Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
Kevin, it was just a --,<u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
...Guess what?,I don't care.
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.,Fuck yeah we will.
Our last game is this Saturday.,No shit.
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.,Yep.
Here, babe.,Thanks.
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -,AHHHHHHH!
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!,Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...,Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?,Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.,Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.,Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?,It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Fan-fucking-tastic?,Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
What about your glasses?,It's okay. I can see fine.
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...,Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I don't... I... I can't remember...,Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.,Andy! No!
What makes you so sure this will work?,I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
What the fuck!? You too!?,I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?,It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.,Well, they are French.
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!,FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!,My uncle's in a coma you moron!
Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies!,Bullshit! You're bluffing!
The ADM. Let's go.,Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?,If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
Another step and he's dead!,Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!,Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
We know you were with her.,Oh shit... No...
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.,What about me?
Andy...,Yeah?
"Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed."  These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.,Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...
Uncle Terrence.,Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
Claude.,I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
Enough. Cut him loose.,I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
Andy, stop! I think he can help you - ,Allo?
Here.,Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?,What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!,When you're older . . .
Where is your home, Anya?,I'm not sure but look. . .
Who did you hear it from?,I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too ,What happened to your parents?
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .,You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.,Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
Why do you want to go to Paris?,I have my reasons.
Come on up!,Why?
Every Russian family has one..,Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
What a beautiful ship!,It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?,Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
Nervous?,Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
I'm so scared...,Don't be
Don't you, child?,Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.,You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!,We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
It's her.,He's her?
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .,Ew. . .  the honest type.
You're a princess...,Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
How is our current financial status?,If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?,Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
Hey!,What?
Singer!,Alvy Singer over here!
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.,Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.,Yes.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?,Why not?
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.,It's okay.
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!,Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?,Tsch.

The alarm clock.,You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?,Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
Stop it, Alvy!,Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.,M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.,That movie makes me feel guilty.
I-you know, I don't wanna.,What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.,Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
Don't give it to me. Don't!,Oooh! Here! Here!
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!,Get him!
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.,I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?,Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!,All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
Well, then, w-who was?,Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!,La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.,Well, no... not just, not only.
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?,I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?

You want your tennis stuff?,Huh? Oh... yeah.
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?,Yeah, my grammy.

I'll see yuh.,Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
Uh, narcolepsy.,Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...,Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Why not?,'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
Oh, I see, I see.,You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
God bless.,Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?,Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!,Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-,No, so help me.

I know you've only known me a short while.,Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.,You don't want me to live with you?
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?,'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel.",Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.,It relaxes me.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?,Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Really?,U-huh.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.,We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.,You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?,A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
David! David! I can't believe this!,And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
Oooh.,I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?,It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.,I don't know.
Okay, okay. Okay.,That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.,Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
Yeah, but it's real close.,Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.,Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
Here's a real present.,What... huh?
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.,How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.,No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
God.,Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
Oh, good. Okay.,I'm cool.
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.,Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.,Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.,Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?,Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!,You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.,Oh, Alvy, come on.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?,No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...,You're mad, aren't you?
Oh!,I thought just earplugs.
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!,Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.,Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
Oh, you got a headache!,I have a headache.
Where are you going?,Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!,I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
Mean?,You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said? Oh, I-I don't understand. Are you joking, or what?
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew.",You're crazy!
Forget it, Max.,We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
Max, the city is terribly worried.,But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.,Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.,Look, uh...
We do the show live in front of an audience.,Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
What's the matter?,I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.,Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
But she's colored.,SO?
They're persecuted enough!,Who's persecuting? She stole!
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.,I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.,Oh, yes, yes.
Now, don't let it be so long, now.,No.
M'mmm.,I just have time to get the, uh-
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.,Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?

Uh, how did this personality come about?,I was very charming.
There were many men interested in you?,Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?,Oh yes.
Had a little help?,Absolutely not.
It's going.  It's going.,And how's the diva doing?
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.,Who, Sally?
Any thoughts on casting yet?,Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?,October-ish.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.,Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.,I'm in mourning.
Why didn't you bring him?,What?
Oh.,Didn't I say?
I'll change back before we leave.,Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.,You want a Tylenol, or something?
I'm glad that's all over for me.,Don't you miss it?
So where is young Jonah?,With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
What is that thing?,So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
Let's get the kids.,Oh my God, the sitter.
Thanks for coming.,Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.,He's not going tonight.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.,Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
It's not a contest.,Damn straight.
I'm the hired help.,Fuck you.
Just did.  Jealous?,When does he graduate high school?
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.,I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.,Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
It was fifteen seconds.,I don't think so.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.,We've only been over this how many times?
You only made half your quote this year.,Well, you're a tower of support.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.,We couldn't be on more solid ground.
What was it?  What the fuck was it?,Ryan's novel.
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?,We're great.
You want me to uninvite her?,No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.,Really?
In the kitchen.,Who'd like to go and find Otis?
Two minutes.,It's alright.  Be our guests.
Okay, knock it off.,Truce?
She left the fucking gate open.,Well he can't have gone far.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.,Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.,Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.,Love?
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.,Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
What are you saying?,Hello?  Last birthday was?
I don't look my age, Joe.,Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
It's a shit novel anyway.,Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.,Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.,You're not ready.
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.,I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?,Everybody hates the messenger.
I don't want to go tonight.,You don't have to.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.,Oh, Sally Mae...
Coffee?,Sure.
We have a gift?,Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
Yes.,I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
The infamous dog?,He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?,Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.,Oh don't.  Everyone says that.
Please, Ryan.,No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink?
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.,Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.,Uh-huh.
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.,What?
Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.,We're way past inappropriate.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.,Come here.
Well, yes, actually.,He always has two or three going...
I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.  Utterly fantastic.,You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...,They're nothing like us.
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.,Not at all.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.,I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?,Yeah.
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?,Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.,"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
Everyday.,I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.,What does that mean?
Well, something's wrong.,Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
Um.  Happy for you.,Thanks.
So tell me, how's it going?,Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
You're my best friend.,That's not an answer, is it?
What did I do?,Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.,Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.,I'll be right out.
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.,What are they?
You don't need to do that.,I don't mind...
Enough about me.,Evie has a little something for you.
Like Joe.,Hmm.  Where are my kids?
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.,I hope they're watercolors!
So where should I put it?,I thought it was okay where it was.
It's much more personal in here.,A notch above the storage room.
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.,She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
I trust you.,Oh Soph...
Well good.  Thank God.,Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
What do you mean, thank God?,Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.,He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.,But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.,No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Tell me about it.,Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.,You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --,Wanna dance?
Really?,Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
And you are...?,I'm Princess Bala.
You dance...,Divinely?
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.,I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
What <u>was</u> that thing?,How should <u>I know</u>?
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.,Climb up that tree and get a better view!
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?,No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Water...water...,Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....,Yes?
Come on, Z.,Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?,Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...,You held onto this all that time?
Why do they have you tied up here?,There's something going on, Z --
Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!,Oh no...
We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!,I'm the Princess, aren't I?
Of course not --,Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
Who is that idiot?,Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.,Duty calls!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?,Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Good.  You're a good soldier.,Thank you, sir.
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.,Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?,I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.,They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.
I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.,Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
...I should?,YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
Ask me why we're so successful.,Why are we so successful?
You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless.",But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
We declared war again?  Are you scared?,I'll be back.
So this is your mother's apartment?,That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.,Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?,Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.,Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.,Sheldrake?
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?,Care to make a small wager?
That makes me feel just terrible.,Why?
Twenty-seven.,You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --,I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
I hope everything goes all right.,I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Oh -- Miss Kubelik.  I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?,I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.,Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
Eight-thirty.,Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.,Oh.
Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'Bye.,Eight-thirty!
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.,Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.,Cheers.
One more?,I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?,No -- I like it.
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --,This is a bad day for me.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?,Why?
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?,Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?,I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
What's her first name?,Miss. 
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.,He doesn't give a damn about me.
You want me to move the television set in here?  You play gin rummy?,I'm not very good at it.
I think I'm going to give it all up.,Give what up?
Cut.,So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.,Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
Are you all right?,Sure.  What's that funny smell?
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.,Are you supposed to?
What are you doing with that?,I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.,You did?
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?,Where?
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.,So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
Are we dressing for dinner?,No -- just come as you are.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.,You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
Shall I light the candles?,It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
I mean, after that?,What?
We're going to finish that gin game.,Oh.
How's everything at the apartment?,Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
I never thought he'd do it.,I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.,That's very wise.
Are you sure? How's your knee?,I'm fine all over.
Mind if I come in?,Of course not.
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.,So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.,What for?
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  How many charter members are there in this little club of yours?,Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
Where is your apartment?,West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.,Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.,So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.,Swap them? For what?
I am?,Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.,Yes, of course.
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --,Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
Yeah --,Now what was your news, Baxter?
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.,Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --,You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
Don't mind what?,You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.,What do you mean, sorry?
But this is the key to the executive washroom.,That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
No, no -- just had a little accident.,What does he mean, accident?
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.,I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --,Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.,Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.,Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.,I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.,It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --,Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.,Yeah.
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.,Let me get my bag.
What are you going to do, Doc?,Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?,It's regulations.
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --,Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.  But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block.  Mind if I cool this off?
How's the patient?,Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Can you use a bottle of champagne?,Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.,Happy New Year.
You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?,You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
Who is Mickey?,My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
Can I ask you a personal question?,No.
Still stuck on her, huh.,Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
Good night?,The party's over.
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?,Who?
Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?,Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?
That guy really must've belted him.,Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
Sleeping pills.,That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
Will you excuse me?,What for? You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?,Let me take that.
I don't believe you.,Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
I want you back, Fran.,Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?,Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
You didn't really believe me, did you?,They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
That's enough, Fran.,Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
You're not being funny.,I wasn't trying.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --,Okay. I'm sorry.
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --,You know I do.
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.,Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
Now, Fran --,And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.,Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.,Atlantic City?
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.,Sssssh.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --,Don't you ever stop talking?
Where does she live?,A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?,You mean you bring other girls up here?
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.,Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
Where are you headed?,What's it matter? Get to the point.
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.,Dreadful.
Two whole drums --,We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
We've been attacked.,I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
Winning the war by yourself.,Part.
Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang.,Who are you ?
It's really too much -- I mean I've collected every picture of her since she was Miss December.,Yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the Delta.
What are you doing out here?,Cook school -- that did it.
Whatdoya think it thinks.,That we're dumber than we look.
There's some bad holes, man, and the cracks -- water's coming through the cracks. Food's shot to hell.,How much is left?
Charlie?,Looks that way.
Who's he?,God knows.
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.,Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !,... he's an amazing officer.
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.,Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
What'd he say?,Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.,Shot himself. What for ?
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.,First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
We could go in tomorrow at dawn -- there's always off-shore wind in the morning.,The draft of that river might be too shallow on the point.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --,I'll go with him --
Get in there !,This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
They're not Cong.,We're Americans.
I --,I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
Who knows? Right.,Looks pretty shallow.
They nail him for it bad ?,He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.,I wonder if that was the same copter.
What does that mean ?,Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.
Our Recon flight ?,Ours.
How did they know?,They must have seen the fire.
No, sir.,This gentleman or myself ?
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?,I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
Yeah.,He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.,Well, he's killing now.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.,I always thought the French came here to get the rubber.
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.,Do you know that jungle?
The wind --,What?
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?,I got bored in Saigon.
Fucking savages.,Who?
You were not coming here, to see me?,No -- no, sir.
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.,What Truth?
I think think a lie stinks.,Oh Captain, that is so true.
Go away -- hide yourself.,What are you doing?
I had immense plans.,I'm gonna get you out of here.
Yes...,I'm taking you back.
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --,Yes, I know...
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...,Both of us...
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...,His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
He'll kill us.,He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
Are you finished surfing?,Yeah... thanks.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?,Nah.
This one , Lance?,Yeah, Jesus Christ !
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?,It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.
What's this tiger shit?,No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
Captain Willard?,That's me.
You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.,Why?
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.,We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
Sounds like he's gone crazy.,No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?,We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?,No. Not really.
Are you warm, Captain?,The river is beautiful.
I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --,Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
Well who the hell verifies that ?,I do.
This -- Bob Hope or the like --,No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --
Well , who's in command here?,I don't know -- don't have any idea -- I'm just the night man --
You came right to it, son of a bitch --,Son of a bitch, sir.
20   CONTINUED:  ,You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season.
34   CONTINUED:,Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
102  CONTINUED:,Wait 'til I'm across!
You talk about ecology -- there it is.,107  CONTINUED:
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?,139  CONTINUED:
Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  That's what you want out of this, isn't it?,150  CONTINUED:
Let's go.,94   CONTINUED:  
184  CONTINUED:,Your infrared camera?
212  CONTINUED:,Keep back.
How long have you been up north?,Six months.
My dad was a Navy doctor.,Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
What happened here?,The radio's on the fritz.
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.,Sam?  We haven't seen him.
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?',Why?
He's coming around fine.,Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.
Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.,Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
Did you catch Corbett?,Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.,You make it sound like a prison sentence.
Be careful, okay?,That's my line.
Leave it here.,Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.,I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.,Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Ben Corbett?,Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?,Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.  Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --,-- Turn around.
Be my guest.,I'm right behind you.
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?,It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.,We've got another two hours of daylight.
There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.,You don't get it, do you?
Have to get these wet things off.,You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
It was blown up with the plane.,Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
Snow's to their advantage, kid. You can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon. I'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away.,Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.,You're wrong.  Everything we do leaves its mark.  You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --,-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
What's wrong?,Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.,Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
You don't care enough about Sam to --,-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
Neff, you know better than this...,You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.,Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --,-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
What'd you say they call these spaceships?,Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black and white smoke.,Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.,Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Thought that door was open last night...,Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.,I'm right fuckin' here with you.
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.,Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...,Go ahead.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?,Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
What is it you want? What?,I want us to go out.
How was it talking to him?,Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Call me as soon as you're settled.,I love you.
Have they done blood tests on him?,Yes.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?,No.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.,Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?,Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
I know. He's just the best.,I've got Jews at my table.
So what are you doing with a dog?,Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?,Otherwise, you're not ugly.
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...,You all set here?
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...,Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.,How ya doing?
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.,I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
Why did yo do this for me?,To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
What's this?,A thank-you note for what you did for me.
Getting loud, getting loud.,He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
Nice of you... thank you.,Thank you.
No, sir...,I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
Hey -- you let him...,You like sad stories -- you want mine.
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.,You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...,Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes.",There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?,To hell with sex.
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.,Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.,I'll take a bus.
I'll take you... why not?,I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
The two might go together.,See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
Cute.,You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
I should've danced with you.,Okay. Good-bye.
What job?,Were you asleep?
I wasn't asleep!!,What a break...
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.,I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
Good night.,Good night.
But what about...,I'll take care of myself --
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.,There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?,I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?,Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?,Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...,Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.,Hope you find him. I love that dog.
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.,You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
How's Verdell doing?,He's a pain in the ass.
Actually, I don't think so.,Wait here.
Terrify me?,See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.,Well, I can't reach them.
Is he dead yet?,No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Oh, is he dead?,Ask him.
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?,I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.,How're you doing?
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.,'Love was... '
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.,I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.,Thank you for walking him.
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.,Get out.
I carry bacon in my pocket.,Oh, my gosh.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?,Got any easier questions?
That's very thoughtful.,Never a break. Never.
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.,This stuff is pointless.
Do you ever get an erection for a woman?,Melvin...
I told you to go on in.,Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.,They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
Did you like it that much?,It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.,Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.,The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.,Where?
Uh, Fontella's,So you're from around here?
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.,No fucking way.
No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!,I know you're going to jump.
What does that fucking mean?,It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.
I'm on the scent.,You're too late.
How in the fuck do you know that?,Do you want Rath or not?
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.,I'm worried about you, Robert.
Deadline?,Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
What?,He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
Get on the expressway.,Where are we going?
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.,Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.,I'm part of the game, just like you.
Now what?,Turn off the engine.
Nikita?,Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
What does that mean?,If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
Why?,Because he is trying to retire me.
And you want to use me to get him?,Yes.
Forget it!,We don't have a choice.
Listen -- I don't even know your name.,Rath.  Robert Rath.
With computers.,It's not the same, is it?
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.,They didn't give you a choice, did they?
No, they didn't.,But you knew what they were training you for?
Women?  No... not really.,Why not?
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.,Why?
No.  Just the first one.,After that?
They become complicated... messy.,Did it ever bother you?
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!,Does that mean it didn't bother you?
Good.,Where is it?
Hey, where are you?,Thinking.
About?,Nothing.
Do you think about the game?,Yes.
I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.,Okay.
You should knock.,Sorry.
Then, we wait.,Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.,Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.,What?  What if he brings it with him?
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.,You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
What did he say?,He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?,I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
They're worth less points.,So?
No?,It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?,I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Attraction is a complication?,It can be.
Is this becoming complicated?,I'm not sure that I care anymore.
Were you attracted to me right away?,No.
Four minutes.,What?
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!,Oh, God.  I see it!
I prefer it like this.,How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
Would you like a drink?,I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
Do you ever regret things you've done?,Everyone regrets something.
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.,Sure.
You're pretty famous aren't you?,I hope not.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.,Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
Right.,I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?,I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
So how's your work?,It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!,Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.,Yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints!
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.,What's that? Free!
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!,What did the beer cost?
That stinks!,Yeah, that could be job number two. I think it's a sewer.
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.,A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?,No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.,Tough break.
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?,None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
Perfect, but I can't use it right now, I've got to get these locks done; it's a matter of priorities.,Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?,I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?,Is it gone four-thirty?
Nope.,Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
Close!,Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
We're going to need it all.,Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.,Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
No, not if you've got better things to do.,Who put a bee up your butt?
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?,It just happened.
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?,She's cool.
A fine specimen for conversion.,What are you on about?
Does Jahn's thing have a name?,Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
Your too good for this town, Buddy.,So I hear.
I stopped by your office. Henry was steaming, he says he's going to throw you out of the window and that you never worked at the Bugler.,He got that one right.
They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?,No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
Yeah, Dave Walters.,Good, what's his number?
Yeah, no problem.,We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....,No, by road?
There shooting at something.,Doug?
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.,So am I.
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.,That's my mum's.
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.,Regards to Her Majesty.
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?,Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
I've been around.,Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.,Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?,I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?,What?
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.,Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
She's tired.,It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.,No way Doug, I can't.
Hi, want to take up dancing?,Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.,Great....How long will it go for?
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?,Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!,How?
Any chance of getting me out on bail?,What is bail?
Seems a shame!,The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
Shall I wash these out?,Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
Don't you have a girlfriend?,Sometimes.
Where did you steal the car?,It's Josh's.
You will wish you hadn't.,Fuck you!
I'll need to make a phone call.,You may use my office.
Sure!,Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
So, he didn't fire you?,No way, he even gave me back pay.
When the hell did you write that?,Just yesterday.
I think we should be going honey.,What for?
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?,In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
You are responsible...What has happened?,We're not sure...
So go dance.,With you.
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --,I'm sorry about how we --
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --,Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
I told him to leave me alone.,Landon --
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.,I need to whizz.
The address?!,York Ave.
I'm very sorry --,What kind of a man are you, son?
I'll take a chance.,Go for it.
So what else is on this list?,It's private.
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.,The world of the dead?
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?,I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
The play's going to be really good.,I'm really glad you think so.
Or anywhere where people might see us.,Belinda's a very jealous person.
You were great the other night.,Thank you. So were you.
What does that mean?!,It means you can do anything.
Hey.,I heard what you did. Thank you.
She great or what?,Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
Like fire.,What?
Excuse me?,Fun.
Stand right here.,Where?
You're acting like a crazy person.,You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.  On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.,What would you do up here?
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.,You planned this --
What's the best thing I can see tonight?,Me.
Are you frightened?,All the time.  I feel like I have no one.
Help me live until I die?,I will.
Now? We just --,I don't want to come here anymore.
'Love is always patient and kind. It is never boastful or conceited -- ',That was read at my parents' wedding.
How're you doing?,Better. I was really angry.
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.,He wants help with his lines --
I'm supposed to always be alone?,I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.,Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.,That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --,I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
So talk to us about something.,Like what, sir?
We didn't tell him any different for years --,Your parents are divorced?
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.,How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.,Praying.
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?,In there.
I thought she built it herself.,She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.,When do I get time for me?
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?,Yeah.
This... is the number one single?,Yes, sir!
Morning Dick.,Marty. What's for breakfast?
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.,Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
How was school today?,Fine.
It's polyester.,Poly-what?
Huh?,Have we ever met before?
Then you'll be going to school here....?,School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I?
What time does school start around here?,Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!,But he didn't ask me.
Uh, hi, Eileen.,How are you?
I don't want to hit you in the stomach!,You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
Why what?,Why is she gonna get angry with you?
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?,Not a holocaust --
Sir, it only costs a nickel.,What?
I'm sorry, there's no answer.,Operator, what's today's date?
March 11th.,What year?
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!,Shhhhhhhh!
Catch you later! ,...To be traveled through
But Professor --,Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!
A gold mine?,Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.,The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!,Ssshhhhh!
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!,Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.,A mall?
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.,The power converter...
I don't recall ever seeing it before.,Well, it was there.
The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.,Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.,Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
That's all taken care of.,Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.,Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
There's no way of knowing.,Perfect...
What year is this?,1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.,87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?,According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.,What? 
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?,Dick? Dick who?
Suzy!,Hi, Marty!
Oh yeah?,Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
How you doing, Cato?,Not bad.
Does he bite?,He never bit me.
You ever held another job before?,I used to throw trash for the City.
We did it, Ray.,You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
Then why'd you do it?,I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
Well, Kit...,Tom...
Good luck to you.,Thanks.
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.,Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?,What for?
You still in school?,Nah, I got me a job.
Can I be honest?,Sure.
Quit my job.,Great.
You want to go for a ride?,Well, I got homework.
You're a redhead.,I know.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.,It's your play.
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?,Yeah.
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?,Don't ask me.
I came in the front.,How bad off is he?
I can look and see.,We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.,You said that once already... Too late now.
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?,Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
How you doing?,I'm fine. Kind of tired.
I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there.,Put that down. It's dirty.
What'd you put him in there for?,Just to keep him out of the sun.
You tired?,Yeah.
I'd like to get out of here.,Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
That's Montana over there.,I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
You smoke Pall Mall?,Yeah.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.,No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Fine.,Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
You're my friend, aren't you?,Yes.
Hi.,Hold it right there.
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.,Then that's it!
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...,I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!,Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
I'm starving...somebody, help.,Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.,Have you warned Professor Hikita?
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...,And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
You okay?,Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
You're a welcome sight...,Just 'grazed' you, huh?
We will, old fried, we will.,Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?,I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
All accounted for?  Where's Penny?,New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.,They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...,Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.,My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...,Everybody okay up here?
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?,I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.,The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
Another 'you'?,Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.,She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.,What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!,Penny--?!  Are you all right?
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.,A what?
What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.,A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
But John Whorfin said kill her.,Damn John Whorfin--!
What's happening with my call to SAC?,Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?,Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Pick those up, Reno.,I didn't drop 'em.
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.,Why me?
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.,Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.,Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.,He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Well... THIS.,You wrote his scripts for him?
Before what?,Before Bill came to Hollywood.
Barton!,I want to know!
How d'ya like your room!,...Who is this?
How long you been up there, Fink?,A week, eight, nine days 
Ever talk to him?,...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.,All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?,It's still a little early for me.
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man  to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.,Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?,Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started
A souse!,You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
I don't understand-,Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?,I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
...Barton, is everything okay?,Yes... Isn't it?
Well ain't that a kick in the head!,Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and  and  and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?,I can feel my butt getting sore already.
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man  from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and  and  and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and  well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.,Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.,Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time ,You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine  you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration ,That's all right, really 
It's okay, it's okay.,Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...,Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
...Did I say rude? People can be goddamn cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I've got a weight problem. That's my cross to bear. I dunno...,Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
How did you know about that?,Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
You're leaving?,In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact  New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
So they say.,Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
Barton. Are you all right?,No... Can I come in?
Why don't we go to your room-,Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
Hold on ,I didn't do this, I did NOT do this
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?,She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
Jesus, Charlie, I...,Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
...I just don't know what... to do,You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on  just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
Sure, Charlie.,Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime  when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
...Yes, thank you.,Lou.
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?,...Both maybe?
I  Mr. Lipnik ,KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.,Congratulations.
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.,With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
Transient or resident?,I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
...Those your only bags?,The others are being sent.
Is this multiple choice?,Nine days  Tuesday 
Got a couple questions to ask ya.,What do you do, Fink?
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.,His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.,Ya see how he's not writing it down?
Second one of your friends to end up dead.,You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.,Only fry you once.
...Maybe we should do a treatment.,Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
Where were you tonight?,Home. Watching TV.
All night?,Yeah.
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.,Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
How are you, Nick?,I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
How about the booze?,It's been three months.
How about the coke?,No.
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?,No, Nick, please --
Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --,Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
What is this interest you've got in her?,My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
I thought you hardly know her.,I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
How long were you dating him?,I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
Was there anyone with you last night?,No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.,Are you arresting me?
I thought you were out of cigarettes.,I found some in my purse; would you like one?
What's your new book about?,A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.,I have nothing to hide.
You like playing games, don't you?,I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
Even though you were fucking him.,You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.,Why not?
I don't know anything that isn't police business.,You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.,There's a name from the past.
I didn't.,Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
How exactly did you hear?,I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.,Don't get too cocky.
Ice?,Please.
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.,What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.,She's seen everything before.
You're in over your head.,I know.
Do you think I told her to kill You?,No.
It's OK.  It's OK.,Make love to me.
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.,What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
Do you believe me?,I don't know.
Can I talk to you a minute?,Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --,Of course I knew.
I hate rugrats.,We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
Did you ever tie him up?,No.
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?,I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.,What was the weapon?
I never heard of him.,Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
Was she ever suspect?,No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her.
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?,Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it.
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?,She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.,I went over last night, too.
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?,I don't believe it.
Why not?,You're my friend, Gus.
If she's telling  you the truth.,Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?,He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.,She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.,Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.,Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.,Yeah.  I know.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?,Is he dead?
Were you with him last night?,You're looking for Catherine, not me.
What was the motive?,She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.
Keep your three o'clock.,Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.,She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything.  I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.,What about me?
I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen.  They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.,She killed him.
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.,It was an accident.
Who are you?,I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
Hey  it's the big A.M..,Rene's been telling me about your work.
Is this finished yet?,I don't know.
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.,You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
Why, so you could humiliate me?,No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
Of what?,The whole thing  painting.
It's in New York.,Oh, I didn't know that.
Yeah... Like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.,Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
Cool.,My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?,I don't like beer.
Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death.,When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.,I really think you should talk to him about this.
When?,How about right now?
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.,I know.
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.,Sure.
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!,Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.,It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
B.B. It's me  Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?,I didn't see you.
What are they?,Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?,We don't hang them at home, y'know  just in the streets..
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here  I made this for you.,Thanks.  Your dad called again  something about a job.
You're shattering all my myths.,About what?
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.,Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!,Come on in!
Guess I just got sick of him.,Can I walk you home?
Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.,I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?,C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
... I'll buy you some new ones.,You don't have any fucking money..
I'm your family.,Basquiat, what did you take?
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee ,Staten Island would be ok.
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.,He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.,That's great.
Come on.,Wanna Mac?
No, I'd like the scarf.,Have a Mac.
You're a fast mover.,No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.,Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother  when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.,I'll make you another one.
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.,I just don't think you're being fair.
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...,"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
I guess this mean we won.,Yes, I suppose that we did.
I can't sleep either, lately.  A little link, between us.  But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it.  That could put a strain on our relationship.,...four, five.
We've met.,Have we?
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.,Treat to be here.
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?,I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?,Had one.  Didn't work.
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.,I'm not scared of you, Max.
I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...,Your blood, Max.
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.,A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--,Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.,The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.,And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.,A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
Wonder if it's worth my time.,We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?,Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..,Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!,Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
Working late?  I'm touched.,No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.,As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
I'm sorry.  I was too late.,Too late for what, dear child?
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.,Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-,Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
I love you, old man.,Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
It's good to see you.,What seems to be the problem?
First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.,Specify, please.
Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.,Pheromones?
You're loosing your cool,I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?,It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...,Mr. Freeze.
Watch the first step.,Surf's up.
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.,I can make it.
No beauty...,Just the beast.
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.,What are you talking about?
I guess we'll just have to kill her.,Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
No sign of the snowman.,Maybe he melted.
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.,I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.,Bruce?  What are you doing?
He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.,But he's never said a word-
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.,Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
Like hell you do.,Dick, don't push me right now.
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.,She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.,I knew you could handle it.
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?,I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.,You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
You will rescue my wife,OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.,Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.,I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.,Not good.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.,To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
What say we turn up the heat?,You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.,I've got to stop him.
Join you?  I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?,Well, I can respect your opinion.
The dreams again, sir?,I think they're getting worse.
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?,A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?,Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
Maybe they're right.,Which `they' might that be, sir?
Why do I keep doing this?,Why, indeed?
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...,Dr. Meridian...
...A bat.,What?
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.,No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
What do maniacs always want?,Recognition, of course.
Letters in the alphabet.,Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.,I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
He's home. I sent the signal.,What's wrong?
Now black rubber.,Try a fireman. Less to take off.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?,Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?,Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
We'll talk some other -,No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!
So glad you could come.,What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?,So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
What do you know about obsession?,Not much.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-,Would you? I'm not so sure.
That kid is amazing.,I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.,The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
But...,Well, I met someone...
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.,I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.,Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
Touchy, touchy.,So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.,Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
How about Richard Grayson, college student?,...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
Edward...,Who is it?
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...,Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
Wait! You said you'd let me go!,Never heard of a double-cross?
How'd you find us?,You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
Where are you sending Batboy this time?,Here. Get a good seat.
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.,Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
A-14.,Miss.
Where's the boy?,Upstairs. He's quite docile.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!,What are you talking about?
Look! Police!,I know. I called them.
Please.,I won't let you have it.
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --,Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.,How do I know you won't keep them all?
... How long have I been out?,Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?,I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
Great.  Give me a grant.,I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.,What is it you want?
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.,Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?,As far as I know.
Do you sail?,Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
Odd desire for anyone.,Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
What did you see?,... Terror.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.,Maybe we should just kiss.
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.,I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?,I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?,No one would miss me.
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up.",The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
Keep her on the line!,... Where are you calling from?
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --,Finding out where she is.
I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.,Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --,Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
We got 'em!,Take 'em! I want his head!
I missed you, Lieutenant.,Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.,What are you talking about?
There was no blood, man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...,God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage.",Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?,Because I want someone I can trust.
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --,JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.,I've considered that possibility.
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --,Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!,Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
How'd you know it was me?,Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.
Where does one man get all this junk?,All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?,Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon,Oh, Bruce...
Are they paying you for all this?,Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.,... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.,... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.,Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!,Allie, he's not.
Not what?,He's not crazy.
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.,Yeah. Deja vu.
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!,God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Do we know anything about him?,Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...,It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...,David, I'm serious!
shhh...,It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
He's not too bad.  I can live with him.,I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.,Thanks, Annie.
Big day today, huh? 78,Uh ... yes ...
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.,oh dear.
Say that again, son.,I beg your pardon?
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.,Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.,Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.,Quite right, sir.
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?,Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.
Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.,Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.,That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
Is Jenny gonna be okay?,She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.
But is she gonna be okay?,How the hell should I know?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.,Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score. Huh huh.,Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
Huh huh huh. He said "anus.",Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.,Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.,Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.,Me first! Me first!
That was boring. Huh huh.,Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
That's not that much.,Yeah really. Let's get outta here Beavis. Huh huh huh. This sucks.
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?,Uh, probably like, another five minutes or something.
Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?,Uh...
Shut up, dill-hole.,Butt-dumpling...
Turd-burglar...,Dill-wad...
Bunghole...,Butt-snatch...
Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.,Yer late.
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.,Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Really? I poop too much.,Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.,Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!,He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?,Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.,Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
Chief, look!,Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?,Uh, Butt-Head.
Really? That's where we're from.,Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
You scored with two chicks?!,Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
You got two seconds!,Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
She's ready.,Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.,Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.,Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.,Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.',Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!,That's my girl!
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.,They make gypsies look good.
Oh, honey, we may need that.,No, I'm not putting up with this.
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.,<u>You</u> left me.
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.,You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.,I don't know... what are you looking up?
We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.',Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.,Wait.
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.,No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?,Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.,Where are your skulls and bones?
What happened?,Three times.  Powerful number.
She's only fourteen...,... acts like she's thirty-five.
Honey.  Let's go.,Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?,I didn't --
Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers.  If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...,... we wouldn't have had our little accident.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...,Let's see if she can get my model back.
Aren't you scared?,I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?,Is this like a trick question?
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.,Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
Did you get the paint?,I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
Wait for who?,For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.,Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?,We tried.
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.,Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...,No.  You don't want his help.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.,About what?
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!,No, wait!
How'd you do on the science test?,It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!,Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?,Are you a spirit too?
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.,I... I don't know what your name is.
Beetle!,Good girrrl!
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?,That's it!
Otho'll know what to do.,What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.,Let me have it.
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!,Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
The attic room is locked --,They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
Answer your mother.,Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.,I cannot believe this.
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.,Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.,This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.,I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.,I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.,Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
Look at that <u>detail</u>!,Look at the tiny figures.
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?,What happened to the people who used to live here?
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.,Hold your breath and we'll pull.
Otho, that's terrible.,My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?,The attic.
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!,I'll need something personal of theirs.
You were wrong, it did hurt.,But not for long...
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?,There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
... He's gone, Chauncey.,Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.,Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.,He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
Do you know Raphael?,No sir, I don't believe I do.
Oh. I have a message for him.,Yes, sir.
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.,Yes. He's a very careful driver.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?,Your family doctor?
Did you lose something?,Yes. I lost my remote control.
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.,Yes.
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.,I am a very good gardener.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.,I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
... Good night, Chauncey.,Good night, Eve.
Chauncey!,Hello, Eve.
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?,... Mentor...?
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.,Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
What is that?,Our greenhouse.
Oh, I like that very much.,Yes, so do we.
... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...,So am I, Eve.
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...,Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.,Thank you, Eve.
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?,No, thank you.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.,I see.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?,No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Yes.,Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...,Thank you.
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!,Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.,The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?,Yes. It's a very good show.
Can you see well?,Yes, very well, thank you.
Do you like it?,Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...,I don't want Robert.
I see.,Your foot! Give me your foot!!
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.,I agree.
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.,Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!,We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!,Oh, good.
I feel very good in here.,Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
No, Ben.,Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.,... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.,Yes. That is correct.
... Chauncey... Chauncey...,Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...,Oh, I see.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...,A flower...
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?,Yes.
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?,I can't write.
... Then you really are a gardener?,Yes.
Good day, Mr. Chance.,Good day, Sally.
... Hmmm... Elevator.,... Yes sir - elevator!
Yes. I've seen that done.,Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...,Yes, I'm very hungry.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...,Thank you.
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?,I am a very serious gardener.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?,Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
... How long have you been living here?,Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?,Compensated...?
... Joe? Who's Joe?,Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
Have you served in the Army?,No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.,Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?,No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?,I would like to stay and work in my garden.
Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.,I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... Kinney, what did you come up with?,... Nothing.
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?,... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...
Do you feel well enough for that?,Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
And look who you brought with!,Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.,No, that won't do any good.
... What do you make of all this?,I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
Yes? What have you found?,We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.,Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?,Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."',Very good, Your Excellency.
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.,Yes, sir.
... So what does all that add up to?,Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
... Well?,Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
You take care too, Bobby.,Mr. Gardiner...
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.,Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
What?,Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
Why'd you do it, Craig?,I'm a puppeteer.
I was worried.,I'm sorry. How was your evening?
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?,Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
Why aren't you at work?,I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.,What?
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?,Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
Suck my dick!,Shut up!
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.,That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
I need a shower.,I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?,I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
People make mistakes.,I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
Maxine...,I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
Sure, after a fashion.,Let me try.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...,This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.,I am a trained performer.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.,Yessir.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.,That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.,I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
Is that true?,Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Yeah.,How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?,You married?
I mean, I am really attracted to you.,I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
This is important!,It better be.
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.,My God.
You're late.,Are you torturing me on purpose?
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.,J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!,Ha ha ha!
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.,Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what its for.
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.,Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
No. Don't be an ass.,Can I be anyone I want?
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.,Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
The Great Mantini?,No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.,Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.,Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Anybody else?,Do we get to wear a crown?
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.,That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?,Yes, Hi.
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?,Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!,Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
She's not available.,We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
Thanks so much for coming over.,Oh, I'm really glad you called.
So, do you enjoy being an actor?,Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.,Yes, Maxine, yes.
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.,You mean with Malkovich?
I'd love to see your work.,Really? Yeah. Okay.
That was incredible. You're brilliant!,You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.,It's okay, my sweet.
Vegas.,Vegas. Can you arrange that?
You've got to be kidding.,I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.,Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
The Word. What you was put here to speak.,That's the last thing they took from me.
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.,What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
You saying nothing counts?,I'm saying they came into my yard.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.,You remember Halle.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...,The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.,WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
What do you know about it? I sleep where I want.,You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt.
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?,More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.
She gone like they say?,Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
You think she sure 'nough your sister?,At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.,Ya think?
Be here. In case.,In case of what?
Won't you be late for work?,Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be.
MAMA!,Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
But mama..,Go upstairs I said!!
Mama let me help you.,NO!...She wanted me to do it.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.,Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?,He ask, I give him anything.
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.,Aw, no, Ella.
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.,You was friends.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.,What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.,Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
You planning to do anything about it?,Oh yeah. I got big plans.
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?,Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.,I don't want to know.
Leave off..,She was only-
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.,Who is she? Where she come from?
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.,Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?,Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that..
Hiya Allan.,Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted.  I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.,Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.,It's the LeBaron.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.,Why me, man?
I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I want Bill Kunstler.,What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
The Gundersons.,The?  Who the fff--
NUSSING!,ANTI-SEMITE!
Can we just rent it from you?,Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
Fuckin' A.,And this guy peed on it.
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!,Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
Where you going, Dude?,I'm going home, Donny.
What tied the room together, Dude?,Were you listening to the story, Donny?
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!,What the fuck is he talking about?
Who has your undies, Walter?,Where's your car, Dude?
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.,They were Nazis, Dude?
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!,Uh-huh.
What have you.  We'll, uh--,We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?,They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
Jesus, man, can you change the station?,Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Please, feel free to inspect them.,I'm not really, uh.
That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.,Uh-huh.
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.,Nancy's pretty good.
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.,In the briefcase?
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.,And the, uh, the briefcase?
I like your style, Dude.,Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Howdy do, Dude.,Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?,Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!,Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?,Yeah man.
Huh?,Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Oh, no.,Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.,He fixes the cable?
Yeah, but what about--,--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.,No it's fine, really, uh--
Dieter Hauff?,Well--yeah, I guess--
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.,Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.,Delayed after-eff--
I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.,Uh-huh.
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.,What do you do for fun?
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.,Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
What the fuck are you--,Walter, he peed on my rug--
So who--,Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
Theodore Herzel.,Huh?
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?,First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.,You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--,What if it's during a game?
That...fucking...bitch!,It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.,Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
...Huh?,Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
FUCK.,What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--,C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?,Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--,The nail polish, Walter.
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--,Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
They're nihilists.,Huh?
Yeah.,And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--,The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Who the fuck is that?,Huh?
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!,Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.
Is this your homework, Larry?,We know it's his fucking homework, Walter!  Where's the fucking money, you little brat?
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?,Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--,Dude?
Huh?,Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
Oh, shit.,He can't walk, Walter!
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!,Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
Dude here.,Who is this?
Dude.,You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--,I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--,Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Employed?,You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
Ah fuck it.,Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything!
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.,Where's the money, Lebowski?
We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.,Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
Shit, sorry man.,Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.,Impressive.
Whatta we do about the Mex?,We'll take 'em in the morning.
What?,They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.,I haven't forgotten.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.,Fry 'em.
Thank you.,For what?
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.,I wouldn't read too much into it.
You don't want to go there.,Why?
What do you want me to do?,I want to see the sun rise.
I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.,Either that or feeding the worms.
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.,Then who does he work for?
And so will we.,Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
Yes?,They've made contact with the Reapers.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?,No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.,Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?,Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
What about you?  You're not coming?,After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.,You little shit.  When did they get to you?
She's been bitten.,You should've killed her, then.
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --,Just do it, old man.
Going somewhere?,China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
Whistler, I --,I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
You're not going anywhere.,Watch me.
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.,Who is LaMagra?
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.,Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
How did you know?,Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.,And that's a good thing?
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.,It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
What are you looking at?,What do you see here?
You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.,He will.
You're hurt --,Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.,For your miracle cure?
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.,Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
-- tearing me -- apart.,I know. Take some of my blood.
No --,It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
Please --,Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.,What about the chemistry panel?
Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.,It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?,Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
You're a monster.,Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
Who are you people?,My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
We keep in radio contact.,You've been listening in the whole time?
Why do you hunt them?,Habit, mostly, just like this.
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.,I'll take my chances.
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--,--my God, Nick???
What're you doing there?,Trying to find the energy.
--stop it! Stop talking about it! I'm gonna freak!,I just wanna go <u>home</u>.
Why?,Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.,Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!,Not the only things missing, Nick.
--the witch kills children--,I haven't killed any--
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--,--whatever; that's her.
--<u>myth</u>--,--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
No.,You sure?
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.,Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.,You don't want it though.
Baby names?,I don't know. Nightmare.
What can I get you?,Sleep.
Just...try and go back to sleep.,I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
Are you marked like this??,Why?
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!,I can't let you in.
Beer and weed is what I've got.,Both. Now.
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--,--no, I think they're all in there.
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--,--which'd be about ten bucks--
You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.,Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
What I never could figure about the movie?,What?
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.,Yeah?
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.,No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
Get <u>out</u> of here!,What're you doing with all this shit?
--yeah, a hand or something--,--coming out of the water--
Me, too.,Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
Get inside quick, they'll stop.,Too busy eating us?
Where <u>is</u> it?,I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
Cotter?,Fucking owl!
Where?,Down there in the Park.
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.,How's she going to know where to--
It's <u>freezing</u>.,Next time try putting on shoes--
Nobody's going anywhere--,--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
Hold this.,What?
What're you doing?,This isn't about us.
Okay, but--,--now there.
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.,No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
<u>What</u>?,Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?,Spite.
Let's get inside.,First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?,All I need--
What--,--oh, Jesus--
--whatever you want, no problem--,--still go see the OB in the morning--
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.,Ancient runes--
What?,You planning on sleeping out there?
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....,At least you still have the tapes.
What?,Why she kills children.
Cotter'll kill you.,He'll never know.
What?,It touched me, don't you see it now?
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.,That's why she kills children.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.,Get some more beer.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.,Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.,They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.,Whatever.
There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.,That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.
"It's why the witch kills children.",I thought all witches were benign and good.
What the fuck's going on here?,Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.,It won't?
Thanks, Meurice.,Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.,No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
Where... where you going?,See a guy.
I could've sworn I heard something.,Door's locked. Nothing there.
Why didn't you get into bed?,I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.,...What do you mean?
...What's going on with you two?,All right...
...Where is everything?,In the trunk.
...You leaving?,Isn't that what you want?
It'll pass.,We don't seem to be communicating--
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?,I own the place.
He needs a room, Dusty.,I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
I reckon I can hear him. TV option, that's a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax.,Tell him the channels, Dusty.
What night is it?,...Friday?
Sign.,I don't know. Motel... Abby--
What "what"?,Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.,Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.,I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
You want me to kill 'em.,I didn't say that.  Well?
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.,Got something to show me first?
Don't throw that out.,Right.
What's this?,What.
The point is we don't serve niggers here.,Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
...I thought you were dead. Going home?,No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?,Meurice...
...Why?,You shouldn't have taken the money...
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.,What's that?
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?,I've seen a few.
To your health, Frank.,Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Come into the study a minute.,Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.,I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.,It must be great.
What color is it?,It's blue. blue velvet.
Okay?,Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!,Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.,We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Not yet.,Oh my God. Is her son OK?
. MOMMY!.,. mommy's here.
Who's this fuck?,He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
Yes, but.,Then, shut up!
Look at these. What are these?,Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Frank gone?,Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?,Jeffrey nothing.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?,Well.
Thank you. honey.,It's okay. It's okay.
Yes.,You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
Do you like me?,Yes, I like you.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.,Don't say that.
Nice guy.  Who's he?,Who's it, you mean.
Yes. Frank-,Frank is coming?
Do you like my body?,Sure I do.
What do you want to do?,I'm doing it.
I want you to hurt me.,No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Do you love me?,Do you love me?
I asked first.,Sometimes I think I do.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!,Just get outta my bed.
There's no disease, I can tell you.,Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
You called me Jeffrey.,I did. are you?
I'll call you.,Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
I don't want to go.,Go where?
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?,Yes.
Oh yeah?,You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
What else is new?. right?,Yeah. What are you doing now?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?,Maybe so.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?,There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?,Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Are you alright?,Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
Yes. I do.,Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that.
Yeah. but.,Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
Okay. yeah, call.,Look. it can wait till Sunday.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.,Are you sure?
Well, how did it go?. What happened?,Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
What did you see?,Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
I'm sorry, I didn't.,It's okay. Don't worry about it.
You want a Dairy Queen?,No way. I'm about to blow up.
Twice. without her sensing anything?,Yes.
Yeah?,That doesn't bother you, does it?
I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you.  . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.,Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.,I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
You were late.,I'm really sorry.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.,That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Shoot.,Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.,Jeffrey!!
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.,You like mysteries that much?
It's good to see you.,Where to?
NO.,Let's wait for some slow one.
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!,Dorothy Vallens?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?,No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Probably not. no. Why?,OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
... Sandy?.,Go ahead!
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.,uh uh.
Good to see you, son.,It's good to see you, Dad.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.,For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Well. Okay.,Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Yeah?,He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Nothing. I'm fine.,You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.,Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.,Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.,Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?,That sounds great!
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.,I'll get a coat for her.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.,Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?,I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?,No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.,Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
This is it for me.,What is?
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.,You happy, baby?
Nothing like this back home.,Derek!
Honey, your nose!,Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?,Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
Tuna, this is crap.,I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?,No, I cam here out of my own volition.
Excuse me?,Something about vengance being best served cold.
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.,What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?,What?  Yeah, sure.
Why are you speaking?,Excuse me?
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?,No.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?,No.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.,It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
Goodness.,Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.,Yeah.  She told me.
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.,No fucking way.
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.,Oh hey, one more thing?
What do you got there, Diego?,Nothing.  Just a little project.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.,Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?,Good night.
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.,We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?,Slow down, George.  Slow down.
Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.,Yeah.  You do the talking.
Where do I put this!?,Try the back bedroom.
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.,I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?
Derek Foreal.,What?
You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.,George, don't be so emotional.  This is business.  Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother.
Well, you know.  It's um...,Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?,You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.,Oh, I see.
I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.,I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
Who's the cheapskate?,You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
Yeah.  Nice.,Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?,Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
Just low.,You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.,Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...,Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?,Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.,Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...,That's where you belong...
I meant every word of it.,Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
How are you doing, George?,What do you guys want?
You hear about your old friend, Diego?,What about him?
George.,Tuna.
George.,Tuna.
Why are you smiling?,Why are you smiling?
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.,She did that before.
Where are you going?,Out.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?,My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.,Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.,Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Hey, George.  You okay?,Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?,Kristina's fine.
Yeah.,Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.,What's happening to us?
Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?,You mean, like a trip?
I fucked up.,Shhhh.
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.,Yes, I am.
For instance, something like this?,Very nice.  I'll take it.
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?,All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
Right on.,G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
Stoned?,I wish there was shit like this back home.
Smith.  Hampshire....,Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.,Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
This is bullshit, George.  We're never going to find anything down there.,You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs.
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.,The strike is a success; but ...
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.,The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.,I understand. What's your question?
Second name.,Sail.
How much are they paying you?,They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
But I haven't shot him.,You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
I don't do that kind of thing.,Then don't complain.
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.,Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?
It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--,Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
Can you read?,Sure ...
Where's Kader?,With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.,No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.,That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
Where were we?,Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...,A name?
Are you ready, colonel?,Yes ... But let me first see you.
We have to find out who else would profit from Marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.,So -- where do we start?
I've been waiting for you to get back.,You got something on the coke?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.,She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?,What did he say about Miss Lawson?
So she knew about his heart?,Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces of sperm on the sheets.  The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.,What'd he die of?
What are you saying, Henry?  That his girlfriend fucked him to death?,Yes.
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?,Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
What did they argue about?,You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?,No -- never.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.,Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
C'mon -- think about it.  If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?,She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
You've been following me?,Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm building a case against her, remember?
Objection!,I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.,Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.,Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
Can I go?,You get his statement?
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?,Yes.
How did he look?,Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Can you give the court an example?,It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.,She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
What happened after that?,I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Did you ever see her again after that?,Yes -- several times.
What kind of information?,She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.,And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
How do you instruct your patients to take it?,I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
High school?,No.
What did he say?,He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
What happened?,There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
How do you know what kind of sex they had?,I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?,He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
Yes -- he mentioned it.,So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
That bastard!,I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.,You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he?
No.,You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
Yes.,You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?,Yes.
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.,Then you would have gotten your money?
Yes.,You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.,Why'd you come here?
Yes.,And she left shortly after that?
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?,Yes.
Do you think I did it?,I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.,You still haven't answered my question.
I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud.  They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.,Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.,Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.,I thought the subject was sex?
How'd you meet Marsh?,I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless.
This is your house.,I know.
Is it against the law?,No -- it just doesn't look right.
Yes -- she did.,Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
Yeah.,Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum.  I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.,You take a lot for granted.
Alone?,Of course.
Something wrong?,Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
I'm dropping the case.,No -- you're not.
I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.,That wasn't the deal.
No -- he's lying.,How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.,We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files.,Why?
Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?,She allegedly humped him to death?
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.,Is Mom yelling at you too?
I love you.,I love you too, Dad.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.,"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?,No, Your Honor.
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.,Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
This is not relaxing.,Really?
I swear -- the both of you.  Some example you set.,Some example you set.
Why don't you talk to him now?,Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
Is that alright, Frank?,Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.,Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
I don't know.,You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
It's more involved than that.,It was a place to start.
Albert's got the stomach flu.,That's too bad.
Not even if they're a dork?,Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
It had to get there somehow.,It didn't get there from me.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.,Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.,Doesn't matter. Move on.
I don't mind waiting.,Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
Well, I can help.,I said NO!
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.,Aw, Betty.
I thought everything WAS arranged.,Well, there's a problem.
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.,Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?,'82.
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?,How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
What are you doing?,This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
Well, I'd like to read them.,No. We're going to lock this up and --
Bar across the street.,Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
Not yet. You want to go?,I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.,I never knew that.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.,Did we want to?
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.,You're right -- that is sick.
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.,No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.,They got heat in Michigan.
Not this kind of heat.,Heat is heat.
Madge?,Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?,No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?,No.
No, really?,Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?,No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
Are you by nature a sadistic person?,No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson.,Francesca.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.,Must be nice having kids.
I doubt that.,Why?
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.,Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
He's very... clean.,Clean?
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.,And clean.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.,But I... We don't even know each other.
Then what happened?,We got engaged.
My mistake. I apologize.,What made you ask such a question?
Francesca?,Yes! Hi.
It's Robert.,Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?,Couple. Want to help?
Take me somewhere.,What?
Yes.,How about Bari?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.,Have you ever been to that station?
On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.,He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
You're somewhere else, where?,Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
Uh-huh. And?,You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
Am I too heavy for you?,No.
Stop it!,You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.,What makes it different, Robert?
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.,Then he can move! People move!
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...,The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
I don't know. Please...,I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?,Yes. And I've accepted.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.,Sure.
Oh my God...!,What happened?
About an hour ago.,They're not going to find her!
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --,It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.,Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
Hell no!,Then what do you care?
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.,Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
Hey, kid.,Yeah?
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.,So what the hell's the good news?
Are you nuts?,The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.,Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.,Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?,Damned if I know.
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.,Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.,But that's your old hood, Pops.
Looking to score?,Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
What else?  Money.,It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.,Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
Those 'fools' are my people.,Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
I said, no thanks.,Go on.  It won't kill you.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.,Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...,That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
You know I can't.,Then fuck it!!!
...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.,You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.,Who?
no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.,You moved into this block?
How do you know?,I manage them.
Careful.  That's bad luck.,That place is already bad luck.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?,Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
The dead get out?,Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.,Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
We gotta jump!,I can't!
We're here.  Where the hell are you?,Back here.  At the end of the block.
Where are we going?  You know I hate surprises.,A little business move I made.  On my own.  I think you're gonna approve.
Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!,I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
Did you do it?,Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.,You were just a kid.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.,That's the past.  It's dead.
Please...help me...,Dad?
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.,What building?
You boys been hitting the pipe?,No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
Jimmy Bones?,Yeah, you heard of him?
You haven't?,Not that I remember.
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.,Potential toxic dump site.
... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.,But the place burned to the ground.
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.,How could that be?  The box was packed!
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.,What we have to do is call the police.
Glenlivet, right, Gino?,I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
Open the case!,All right!  Where's the key?
Where is it?,Where's what?
The money!,Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
Sit down, Gino!,No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
Oh, shit ...,Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.,What are you going to do with it?
They just left, didn't they?,What are you, drunk?
That doesn't make any sense.,Why?
I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!,But you know he did it.
You can't leave.,The hell I can't!
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.,You don't, you can't believe that ...
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!,Caesar, someone could see us out here.
Shut up, Violet!,He can't kill you --
Shut up, Violet.,Let us go and we'll make a deal.
What did she do to you?,Everything you couldn't.
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.,Shut up!
How's it going tonight, fellas?,Pretty good, sir.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?,Go right ahead, sir.
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.,Good idea.
Now, where the fuck is my money?,Lick me.
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.,No.
You can't kill me yet.,Why?
No, Cease.  There was no answer.,I thought I heard someone knocking.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.,Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
You got the key?,Oh yeah.  Violet!
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.,How do I know you are cops?
Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator --,Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
Oh, I'm sorry --,No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
Truck.,Truck.  Of course.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.,He said you lost something.
Do you have a pot or a bucket?,Sure.
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --,No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
...  I needed that.,Tell me about it.
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?,You have to ask?
How long have you been with him?,Almost five years.
Five years is a long time.,Yes, it is.
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?,The redistribution of wealth?
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.,I guess I wanted to.
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.,Is that what her daddy tells her?
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.,I suppose he just wants to watch.
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.,Even though he knew about you?
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.,For what?
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?,What choice?
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.,Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.,Is that what you think?
And where is it now?,In his office.  I saw it this morning.
It's in a case, on his desk.,Does the case lock?
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.,Like each other?  They hate each other.
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?,Yeah.
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?,Yeah, twice.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.,Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
Any bodyguards?,Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
There is no going back.,When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
Why?,Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.,C!  Shit, I'm sorry!
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.,It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
I'm sorry, Corky ...,Don't be sorry.  Help me.
Done.  We go now.,Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet?,Hey, Johnnie ...
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?,I think everything is okay.
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.,I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
I know you will.,Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?,You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.,Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.,I'm not asking.
Forget it.,What do you want to do?
What do you mean?,Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
Treadstone.,...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
Are you Treadstone?,Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?,It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?,Look, maybe I should just...
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.,Thanks.
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.,Really.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.,Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
I said ten thousand.,You have blood on your pants.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --,-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.,I won't hurt you.
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.,I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.,What?  Like amnesia?
That's what I'm saying.,
Okay, so you're a victim.,There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...,That's it?  Is that it?
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!,I didn't know this would happen.
But the police --,-- there's no time --
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.,Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
<u>So what are we doing</u>?,Go back to the hotel.
xxxxxx,xxxxxx
xxxxxx,xxxxxx
xxxxxx,xxxxxx
What was I thinking, right?,I can't protect you anymore.
Can I help you?,This your store?
Where did this body go?,I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --,-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
xxxxxx...,xxxxxx
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.,Hang on... 
What the fuck is he doing?,Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
What?,Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?,I don't remember Zurich.
You drink rum?,I don't know.
...ergency procedures.,I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
...your ducts?,I fixed it myself.
Sign the form so we can get to it.,... get to it.
Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.,What? You mean you've got ...
Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?,Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?,David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...,I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...,Beginner's luck.
Thanks very much Sam.,That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...,Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
Help me!,I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
You are late.,Even later.
Hello, Jack!,You remember Alison?
What?,I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.,You got the wrong man.
Tell me about Layton.,She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
Out of kindness.,Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?,Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?,Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.,Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?,I do. Goodbye. 
Stamped?,No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
You think these are tits don't you?,Ah.
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!,Who are you?
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.,Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
I mean, it doesn't suit you.,Suit me?
Look at that - right on time.,What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Security.,You're joking.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! ,Cut it out, Sam.
Shit! The house is on fire!,"And your children all gone."
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.,Are you still following me?
They're gone.,Are you sure?
Don't you like parties?,C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
Isn't it? Whose is it?,Information Retrieval.
A cheque.,The refund for Tuttle!
Try next of kin.,Next of kin!
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.,Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?,I delivered it.
What! Shit!,It's what you wanted isn't it?
Sod it, it's broken!,You haven't switched it on.
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.,A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
Numero une, crevettes  la mayonaaise. ,I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
My husband's dead, isn't he?,Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
What have you done with his body?,Um ...
Uh ...,He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?,What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.,I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?,Er, yes ...
Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce. ,It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
But I could be anybody.,No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?,I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.,Fixed?
Now look what you've done to him.,Have you got one or haven't you?
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?,We'll be back.
Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this!,Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount,Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
Thank you very much. How much will it...?,On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.,What if there is no tomorrow?
No, no, that's impossible.,Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
Es impossible.,You can trust me on this one.
In that time, you ever have sex?,Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
Where is she?,Sleeping in the back.
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.,Got a beer?
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.,I was tired. I needed a coffee.
You're not going to die.,What did you say?
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.,Oh man, Bucky.
He's very very sick.,I know him. That's Noel.
Is there any chance?,I guess there's always a chance.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.,Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.,He's working a double shift.
Yes?,Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
Sleeping.,I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.,You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
He's better.,Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
Five years.,Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
I think I'd remember that.,Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?,Because you can barely walk.
I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.,He'll be all right.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.,It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.,No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.,Make a left here. I want to stop.
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.,I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.,What's wrong.
It's coming.  Hold her down.,What's that, Frank?
Don't give me that look.,What look?
What do you think?,Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.,What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
Where's Burke?,Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
I'm sorry.,You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?,Look out!
Where you going?,C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
Mr. Oh.,It's early for him.
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.,You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.,What do you want to break?
I don't know--let's break some windows.,Why?
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.,That's ridiculous.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.,You learn that in the army?
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.,It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.,You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
Stomach again.,No way!
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.,No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.,Nice, Jane.
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.,I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.,Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.,What's wrong with it?
This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.,We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.,Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
What did they do with you?,They booted me out of Washington.
Hold it down, okay?,Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
Hi.,Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --,I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
He excels at gratitude.,Are you any closer to a decision?
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?,I don't like the word gay.
Which would you prefer?,Ravenous homosexual.
Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.,At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.,A half hour in the lobby.
Okay.  Let's do me.,Sure.
I'd give anything if that were true.,Good night.
Okay.  Great line at the end.,Did you shoot their boots?
Of course.,We can cut back at the end.
I write for you sometimes.,Not because you have to.
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.,Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Yes.,Good.
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...,I didn't know you were going with him.
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...,As good as humanly possible.
Did it really go well?,Define your terms.
Do you feel good about it?,No.
Aaron, will you tell me?,It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?,I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.,Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.,No!!!!!
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.,Yeah -- being a basket case.
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.,This isn't friendship.
How?,Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?,Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.,In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
That's it.  I resign as of now.,Stop it.
I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.,Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.,I understand.  I'll go with you.
Just when do you start, telling people?,Almost immediately.
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.,You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
It's Aaron.,Yes?
Play back the last line...,He said something about...
You know, I like Tom, because hi...,Bobbie, please.
Yes.  How do you know?,My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.,Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?,No.  Really...don't worry about it.
Is everything all right?,Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...,No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
Bye, sweetie.,Okay, sweetie.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.,Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that.
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?,I like "godsend."
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.,How are you at back rubs?
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...,What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?,I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.,Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?,Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
Yes.,I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?,Why, you need me for the story?
So you like me, huh?,I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
You okay?,Great.
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.,Well, when?
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?,Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
Hi, again.  Sorry about...,No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
What?,That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?,Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?,Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.,You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
I knew what you meant.,What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...,Then you should stay here.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.,I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.,How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
That's enough.  That's enough.,I'm sorry.
Are you okay?,Yes, I'm sorry.
Don't you work here?,Not anymore!
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?,Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
It's kind of dark -,Shh!
I'm almost ready -,Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
That doesn't look like very much clay.,Oh it's enough...
What the hell's going on?,Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
See you later -,Righto.
Great!  What is it?,It's a...full length life-size figure!
What's it called?,Murdered man.
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!,Now you're a professional!
Hi Walter.,Carla...
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.,Oh...
What's up, Walter?,I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Oh yeah?,Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?
It's true, isn't it?,Every word...
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.,You think I'm creative?
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?,Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
That's word for word.,Is it?  I've forgotten.
Here you go, enjoy.,I hope this was made with egg whites!
Maybe so...,I wouldn't give up your day job.
Are you alright?,Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.,Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?,Don't ask.
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?,I know, man.
You...made that?,I said I did, didn't I!
Alright, I'll tell you what.  I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty.  How's that?,Sure!  So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.
People seem to like my cat.,Enough already about it - get to work!
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.,Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.,A parakeet?
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?,It was.
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.,Yeah?
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?,Uh, sure.
Did you see my cat?,Yeah I did.
I also saw the girl give you this.,Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.
Police officer.,You're like an undercover guy!
I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now!,Telling you what?
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!,Smack?
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?,Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
I- don't know what you're talking about!,You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?,I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!,Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?,Uh, I don't know.
Why on Earth should you be so depressed?  Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!,I thought you didn't respect money!
I get it Walter.  I get it.,What do you get?
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.,I can't.  I gotta go home.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.,If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?,I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
I don't think this is gold.,Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
I look horrible.,The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.,Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
I'm hungry.,I mean it.
Wheels?,My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.,Yeah, I guess.
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.,Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.,'Bye.
I don't understand.,Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
You left me a message?,I'm out of here.  Jenny.
Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.,Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
I am a God!  A God!,I am so sure.
I'm going to the dance.,What for?
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.,Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
He did what he was supposed to.,But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
I'm going out the front.,Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off.  We could maybe wait till later.,Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
Like what?,Like my homework.
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.,) What do you think?
What are we doing?,Why don't we see a movie?
You were supposed to be here at three.,I forgot.
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.,You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?,You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
Time to do what?,To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.,Yes.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?,I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...,China.
I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.,Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.,Our purposes.
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?,Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
Oh, him.,Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?,We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
Uh... gym.,Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
Sporting events, yeah.,All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
No -- you don't have to --,Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!,I had to test you.
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.,Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.,Your turn.
Same one.,Oh.
How can you keep doing this?,It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
I'm curious, is all.,Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?,That's the plan.
-- like she's gonna kill me.,I was just scared is all.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.,Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many.  To feel their souls coursing about me.,What's happening?  What do you want?
So very much.,My parents have money...
What... are you?,Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
I can't!,You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
Okay, let's go.,But --
And Spring Fling.,Okay.
Buffy!,What is she...
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.,Wit-tay.
They'll kill us!,You want some punch?
Oh, God.,He is so bald.
The homelesses?,Oh, please.
Smell of booze much.,Nice much.
What are you talking about?,Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
And the January Semi-formal --,Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
Ah, you'll be coming back.,I don't think so.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?,Run.
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.,Switch nostrils?
How was that?,A little better.
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--,Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
Just till I lose.,Get over here.
How 'bout a back rub?,No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--,Yes I do...
No!  You're playing with my mind!,I'm trying to play with your body!
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--,--but you're father's in there!
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.,That's great!
I'm Crash Davis.,Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.,I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.,When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.,What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Don't tell anybody.,Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.,Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?,You got me all confused.
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.,I want you desperately!
Who are you?  Do you have a job?,I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
I doubt that.,Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I don't know if I'd go that far.,It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?,Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Ninety-five miles an hour.,He looks great, just great!
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...,He'll learn.
No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly.,Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?,Who's he play for?
Don't bump me.,It was a cocksucking call!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!,Beg me again!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!,You're a cocksucker!
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?,Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-,I thought I was--
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.,I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?,I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.,Annie's a smart lady.
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.,It's time you started working on your interviews.
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.,You fuck!
Why am I a fuck?,Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
Crash Davis?,The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?,I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down
Eight and twenty-four.,Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
It's a miracle.,Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?
It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers...,Why are you doing this to me?
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.,Good to see ya.  William would you...
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.,Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.,This is a very auspicious occasion.
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.,It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.,These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?,They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
...been right, but who knows?,Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
Fine, fine. How's your family?,Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.,Speeding?
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...,...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?,702 472 1862.
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.,Yeah, sure I do. Why?
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.,Well...
Dad!,What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.,Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.,Listen...
Okay, Sammy.,Somethin', huh?
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.,I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.,Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.,To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.,Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?,No.
What?,Then he called me a faggot.
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.,You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.,That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.,What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.,What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?,Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?,Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
No, no it's okay.,It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.,Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?,No, I don't wanna come -
You should say so.,I don't wanna come along with you.
All right, fine.,I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.,What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
Yes, you lost your control.,Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?,Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
Listen, I would -,The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
That's right, yeah.,A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!,Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
Back -,...you? Do you remember what I told you?
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -,You never - ?
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.,Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?,No, I'm not okay.
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?,I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.,How do you do?
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?,I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.,I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.,Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.,Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
...position...,'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...,She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.,...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
Sam, we got a problem.,What is it?
Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.,We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?,You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
Oh, it's so soft.,It's nice isn't it?
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?,You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
Oh, fabulous.,...they didn't know what really moved her.
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?,Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he?,No, he didn't.
You didn't have to beat him up!,What?
You can't make me stop caring...,What? What?!
If not for me, at least for Amy.,Okay, okay.
You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...,...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me.  Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I -,We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.,What do you mean?
Right.,I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?,I gotta tell ya...
It's under...,...twenty-five thousand?
...the rest of the two million is still there?,Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.,Okay?
Yeah.,At the most, which is impossible for him.
Get off of me! Stop it!,Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!,You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.,Who were you with?
I was with somebody.,I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.
I mean, it could get us both killed.,I can back him off.
Oh, sh-,Listen to me.
You are not threatening me anymore!,I'm not -
If she calms down, I will let her in the house.,I am calm!
...Well, I've got a large family.,How many kids do you have?
Okay, I'll -,What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?,Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?,You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.,I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
Excuse me.,What?
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.],Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.,Sam?
Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!,He won't...
He won't let me in my own house!,Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've got some complaints about - about the noise.
And here. Here.,Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
It looked like a fuckin' gun!,You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -,Nicky, I'm sorry.
He's comin' over.,Great!
Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.,Carmine left?
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -,But I'm just trying to leave.
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.,Mm.
Hi, how are you?,Okay, Sammy.
Tell me.,I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace.,I do.
Thanks.,Yeah.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.,Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?,I'll be there.
Yeah.,Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.,I did what you told me to.
He hates my fuckin' guts.,Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
Yeah.,Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
Nicky, please...,Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
You fucked with me for the last time!,Okay, yeah.
I'm sorry.,Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.,What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Well, how 'bout that?,Come on! 
I'm here.,No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?,Promise?
I just talked to him.,So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!,'Go! Go! Go!'
Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!,Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her.
Wow.,Boy, look at this place, huh?
Well, how come I laid nine?,'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
Smarten up.,You jag-off.
Come here, come here.,Get up.
You walk past me?,Hey. This is Shelly.
Sue me, you Jew fuck!,Let's get out of here.
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.,Angelo and Buster.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?,Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Don't know.,Dominick said they're in the motel?
Whoa. Calm down.,Get out. Get out! Get out!
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.,Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
Frankie!,No more! You see? Watch!
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!,Fuck you, you motherfuck!
No more fuckin' dirty work!,No, no, no, no!
How you doin'?,How you doin'?
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.,Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
Since when do you talk like that?,I'm sorry.
That's enough.,I'm sorry.
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...,...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
Hi.,Having a good time?
I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...,This looks promising...
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.,Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
,That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..,I wonder..
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?,You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..,At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.,A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.,I lied.
There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.,Oh, how long have you had your own route?
Selina, are you okay?,Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.,Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...,It may be time to get the police involved...
I've been looking for you.,I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...,I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
God, can you hear me!,Wha-at?
Catwomen. Lots of them!,Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
Pass!,You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.,You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..,I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
"Dat's gotta hurt!",He didn't remember to roll up his window...
What a "drag.","Well done," Cactus.
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.,How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
God-damn..,What did you say?
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...,I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...,Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..,I got her...
Car wash, Captain?,Absolutely.
Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.,Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...
I loved you.,I know.
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..,And...your point?
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.,"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
You think so?...Selina?,You've seen me...
Spooky.,Spear.
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...,"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
Hey, you're anti-male.,Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..,Uh. "Thanks?"
Yeah, she's okay.,Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
Hey, Captain God!,What did--?
Nothing. How's your hand?,About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...,Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.,Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
Okay, deal.,"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
Don't sneak up on me...,Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.,Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..,Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Was someone in an accident?,Do I hear a woman's voice?
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?,I didn't hurt you.
Will you two cut it out?,This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.,Then whose is it?
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.,I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.,I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
Nels reporting in.  Sit down where you are.  Arms folded.,Yes sir.
He's seen both of us now.,Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
If you know that just back off.,Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
And stop with the directions.,Make a "U" and go back.
I thought you said you could handle him.,I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.,What am I supposed to do?
Nels?,I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
I don't want to know --,My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
Where'd they take you to?,I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?,No -- nothing.
The cops could trace this call back to you.,One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Please.,Shit!
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.,They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Stop throwing names at me.,Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.,He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.,Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.,They say my work is somewhat derivative.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.,Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.,A price on everything.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.,I'm about ten blocks from the school.
What's happening?,She's gone --
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!,When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
Do you know what's in that box?,I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?,To hide it from the I.R.S.
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.,Lucky for them they didn't.
Yes.,Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.,All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Whose money is this?,It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
The guy with the transplant.,Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.,He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --,Stop talking like that!
It could be a fire.  This is Malibu.,No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.,That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.,The money, Nels ... ?
Think you could do a picture of me?,I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
Five ... six.,Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
Pass.,A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.,I wish it had never been invented.
I don't know what you mean.,I still don't see you.
It's in the process.,I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
You should've done all this before.,I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.,The fuck I will!
Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.,You want us to get ourselves killed?
Who's this?,I thought you'd know me by now.
I can see the benefit in that.,You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
We're gonna get there first.,How do you know?
Where's the backpack?,None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
I'm in awe.,Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
I already called for an ambulance.,You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.,Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
He's what she should run a mile from.,Then why doesn't she?
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.,I'm sorry.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.,She's not a girl, Col --
Just cut his hair, you know.,Yeah?
He's back, Col,Hi.
Fuck it, is what I say.,Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
You fucking promised.,Did I?
Don't chuck my clothes out!,Take your fucking goldfish, too!
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?,Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
Who?,Guy I work with.
No.,Scottish?
How'd you guess?,The accent, I suppose.
You old-fashioned?,Must be.
You all right?,Yes, thank you.
You on the game?,God no. I'm a hairdresser.
Someone out there.,Jesus fucking Christ.
As different as it's possible to be.,Tell me about him.
No --,Did you do that to him?
You want to know how I kissed him?,Yes...
Did he come here too?,Is this an obsession of yours?
Maybe.,He did sometimes.
Even now.,No...
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.,Don't call me that.
Kind of liked you as a girl.,That's a start.
So I'm sorry.,Make it up to me, then.
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.,Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Don't.,Sorry.
I should have known, shouldn't I?,Probably.
So I got it wrong, then.,Not at all, honey.
Don't.,Okay.
Come on.,You gonna tell me why?
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --,Not here.
She from Scotland too?,You could say that.
What you doing, Jimmy?,I'm not sure.
You said anything, Dil,A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
Why?,It's a secret.
Don't call me that --,Sorry. What you doing?
You heard what I said, Dil?,My pills...
Yes.,I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
You tried.,Don't you want to kill me?
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.,Okay.
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.,Let me go, Dil
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here,Let them come then.
You like me now, Jimmy?,I like you, Dil --
More endearments.,I like you, DIl
Say it again.,I'd do anything for you, Dil.
What's Fergus?,It's my name, Dil --
Yes.,Tell me what she wore.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?,The Metro.
Don't go looking for it, Dil.,Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
Fergus!,You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?
Hey -- what's he like?,Horny bastard.
Tough work, that.,Someone's got to do it.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?,Leave me alone, Jude.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.,I heard.
Eddie and Tinker died.,I know.
So you did fuck up.,Yes.
Leave her out of this.,Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
But, then, I don't have a choice.,Och, you do, Fergie.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.,You may be right.
Who's the old geezer?,Some judge...
So?,And anyway, he's seen our faces.
So he knows your name?,I told him.
Back in a minute, Jody,You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Why do you want to do that for?,Would make me feel better about it.
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?,A hotel?
Thank God for that.,You being cynical, Hennessy?
Eat something, would you?,Can't.
I seen your fucking face.,So, what do I look like?
Thank you, handsome.,My pleasure.
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.,Can't we take it off?
No?,Nope. Not handsome at all.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.,So I've noticed.
What makes you think that?,They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
What do you know about my nature?,I'm talking about your people, not you.
What the fuck do you know about my people?,Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.,Shouldn't take it personally.
Now put it back in.,Give us a break.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.,Shut up, would you?
See? I was right about you.,Don't be so sure.
Depends on what you believe in.,What do you believe in?
You liked her?,Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
Help me.,How can I?
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?,Me? No, I'm not good for much...
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.,Thought you liked me, bitch.
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.,Where are you, ol' buddy?
Oh, come on!,-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
I could eat a horse.,I think that's what you ordered.
Oh, you should see your face.,What about it?
What is it?,Open up.
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.,Let's look anyway.
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?,To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
Now what?,Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.,Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.,Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
You didn't have to chase me so hard --,Here, give it to me.
Then say it.,Reggie -- listen to me --
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.,What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.,Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.,Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.,But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
And I'm afraid we want it back.,But I don't have it.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.,You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?,Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
No, what?,That's not Carson Dyle.
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?,I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --,Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?,Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
That's the spirit.,Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
No, Mrs. Lampert.,But no one actually saw him die.
Yes -- ?,Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Are you sure there's no mistake?,None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?,The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.,Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.,Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --,Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?,We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Starting with his own.,Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
But you're -- divorced?,No.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.,How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
You'd lie about anything.,Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
Very pretty. Now what?,I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.,And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.,But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?,It's all right with us --
Your --,The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?,I met a man with sharp nails.
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?,Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Sure.,Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.,Alexander.
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.,Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
Because he's wearing moccasins.,Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.,I think I love you, Alex --
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.,I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.,No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
No -- not yet.,But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.,Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.,What do you mean?
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.,You mean, you're a thief?
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.,Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.,No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.,How much is it worth?
The money is unimportant.,I'm afraid it is important.
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.,You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Flix -- are they for sale now?
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?,And if it is?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?,I don't know anything.
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.,Leave me alone -- !
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --,Stop it!
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.,But his mother --
You loved him?,I'm very cold.
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.,I'm very confused.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?,I don't know.
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --,A letter? May I see it?
Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --,-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
Voil what?,Up there! I would put it up there!
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.,We won! We won!
I don't know -- how would I know?,I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?,Yes.
Well, you're honest, anyway.,Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
I'm not sure I --,Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
Is your husband with you?,Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
Shakespeare never said that.,How do you know?
What's going on?,Don't you understand French?
I'm still having trouble with English.,The man and the woman are married --
Of course? I thought he was dead.,He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.,How do you shave in there?
Go on.,That's all.
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.,That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
What'd he say?,He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.,Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?,Va jouer, mon ange.
He knows everything.,Don't you want me to stay?
I'm glad. But what's all this?,The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
I don't see him.,We will separate -- you look over there.
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.,We want that money -- now!
Yeah?,I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
Why?,He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?,WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
I get all your CDs.,Not my imports.
Hi Jody.,I just wanted to check that you were okay?
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.,Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
is there anything you do?,Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.,That's impossible.
Hi honey.,Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.,I want you to head right home after school.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.,I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
Not much further.,You never went, uh, all the way?
Ok.,Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
Who is she Daddy?,Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
We're seeing all the signs in town.,I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
What happened?,Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
Did you warn her?,No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
She was murdered?,No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
Is there a picture of her somewhere?,No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
Really?,Yeah. You should check downstairs.
I know where you're going.,
Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.,Jesus. Any word from Brent?
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.,Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
You fucked me up!,What?
We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.,Really?
What do you know about my father?,He's a rapist. Like mine.
You're the killed.,Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
You ok?,FINE. Are you?
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.,You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?,No.
You know I want to go with you.,I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.,My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.,So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?,Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
You flaunt some slut in my face.,Sharon's far from a slut.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.,Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.,This party is sick.
Mom?,Yes?
She's nobody you should be concerned with.,Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.,Attacked how?
Yes.,Who was the fourth?
Yeah.,I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
Kenny's aunt?,Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
What?,There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
You're so beautiful.,So are you.
Unfair?!,Yes. Unfair to me.

How wonderful for you.,Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.

Look at that.,Heat's murder.
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact  it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.,'Course you do, Jake.
Sir?,I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.,It doesn't hurt.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.,No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.,Tell me. What do the police say?
They're calling it an accident.,Who's the investigating officer?
None.,That's too bad.
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.,Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
Yes, his girlfriend.,You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.,How did you find out?
Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...,I've got her.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?,No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.,You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
...No...,You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
What kind of guy do you think I am?,Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.,Call me Jake. How is everything?
Off the alley.,Could you drive me somewhere?
How much do you owe me, Curly?,Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.,Okay.
Congratulations.,Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.,No.
I don't want it anymore.,No?
No. It was an accident.,You mean that's what you're going to call it.
No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.,Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
Isn't that your number?,Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
Absolutely.,I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
What are you talking about?,C'mon I'll show you.
It's too late.,Too late for what?
What's the maid's address?,She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
That's it?,Yeah.
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.,Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...,But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
No.,Do you know where she might be?
You and your husband never discussed her?,He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
Mr. Gittes.,Well yes.
Not that Mulwray?,Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
Iced tea.,Yeah. Fine, thank you.
My husband's at the office.,Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
I should talk this over with your husband.,Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?,You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --,It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.,I'll stop by.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.,...Just a minute...
You left your keys in the ignition.,Oh... thank you.
I got your check in the mall.,Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.,Why?
Mr. Gittes.,Did he know?
Is there anything else you want to know?,Where you were when your husband died.
You must've had a reason to ask me that.,No. I'm just a snoop.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?,More like other people putting their business in my nose.
Another satisfied client?,Another satisfied client's wife.
Know him?,No, I think I'd remember.
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.,Is that unusual?
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.,Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
...No. Why was it.,I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
What's wrong?,Your eye.
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...,...A flaw...
Where are you going?,Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
I know.,He owns it. You know?
What did he say?  What did he say?,That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
Do? To who?,Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
I can't...,Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?,I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.,What'd you expect? That's his job.
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.,Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.,When did you come in?
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?,Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.,Oh no.
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?,No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
The obituary column?,You'll find one of those people.
Yeah, Sophie.,A Miss Sessions calling.
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.,Okay.
Oh my goodness.,Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.,Oh, good.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?,I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?,Hope so. He's working for us.
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.,Only when I breathe.
Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.,Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
Do you know me?,Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
The L.A. River?,Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?,I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
Of course not.,Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.,Yeah, I'll do that.
Mr. Mulwray, please.,He's not in, Mr.?
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.,Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.,Along with Mr. Mulwray.
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.,I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
Neither do I.,No, you have a press agent do it.
Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?,I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
That right?... She used to be some looker.,She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.,You must be thinking of a different daughter.
Course, she settled down nicely.,Well, you never know, do you?
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.,We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
You must not come here! How many times do I have to tell you?  If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame...whoosh! And turn into a piece of...,...and turn into a piece of charcoal!!
'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...'  You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!,But you don't have any kids!!!
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!,Then why don't you change jobs? 
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. ,But don't you like anything about what you do? 
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? ,Come in, Alfredo.
Yes. I want proof.,For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? ,Yes. 
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... ,What you say is wonderful! But sad...
Thanks for all you've done for me.,Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little... 
You understand now? You see it clearly?,Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
My name's Salvatore...And yours?,Elena. My name's Elena.
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...,One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.,They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...,Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!...
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?,The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..." ,Go on!
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -,I didn't see that.
It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A new broom sweeps clean.,Oh!
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -,I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -,Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
Who else you been to see?,Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.,I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -,Yes -
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.,In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.,It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
What's the matter?,Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.,Don't I always?  Most of the time?
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?,Yes.
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.,Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.,Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.,It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
Was the show covered by every department?,Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures.
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.,Of course.
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.,I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.  But I'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.
Hello, Brad -,Emily -
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -,Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
I know it is, Brad -,He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
They won't do anything to Junior, darling.  Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -,Please don't talk any more, Charles.
Oh yes, there is.,I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -,You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -,Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck.
You're very easily amused.,I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
A rooster?,You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?,Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
Yes -,As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.,I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -,I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!,You're my wife, Susan, and -
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.,We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
Don't tell me you're sorry.,I'm not sorry.
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -,- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -,I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
Impossible!  Impossible!,Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
You goin', Mom?,Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -,I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.,Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
Get Dr. Corey.,Yes, sir.
Yes, Mr. Kane.,Not my wife - not either of them.
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.,I didn't used to be afraid of it.
That's the second sentence you've started with "I" -,People are going to know who's responsible.  And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly.  And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?,Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -,How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
Yes?,It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -",Charlie -
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -,You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.,I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.,Why, Brad?
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.,I know you will.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?,Mr. Leland sent back that check.
What check?,You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
Mr. Leland, you were -,You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.,He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
Yeah, all in crates.,There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.,I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?,Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
Yes, and maybe he didn't.,Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...,But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.,Good!
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.,Queer?
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.,What about that apartment?
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?,Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?,I'll have a highball.
Are you sure?,Am I sure about what?
Jesus!,It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
Fifty-five.,You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
That's it, everybody out.,We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.,Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
You can hold me down.,Can I join in?
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.,Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.,Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
Am I missing something here?,I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
He was?,It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
I was here the whole time.,You two better quit it.
When did you get back?,Just now.
It's not what you think.,What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.,You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.,How do you know that?
I love a macho faade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?,And you came here to what? To comfort me?
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.,So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.,But can we date?
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.,Let me take you out tonight.
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?,I hear that's a rather popular date.
He's not invited.,He's your fianc.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.,Who doesn't?
Promise me it'll always be like that.,Like what?
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.,What time was this?
If you can just wait a few more minutes.,Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!,In a second!
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?,Lenin's Tomb.
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.,Are you open?
Pack of cigarettes.,What's your point?
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.,So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
Cute cat. What's his name.,Peptic ulcer.
So?,So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.,Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
You only brought one ball?!,I thought Redding had like three balls!
What smells like shoe polish?,Go open the sore.
You don't want to know.,You called Caitlin again?
Great story, isn't it?,That girl was vile to you.
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.,You think things would be any different now?
I'm talking to myself here.,No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.,Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!,You know what I just watched?
Empire.,Blasphemy.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.,There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
I guess.,Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
More or less.,The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
So they build another Death Star, right?,Yeah.
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.,So?
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.,Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
Why'd you apologize?,What?
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.,I don't back down.
At least we're stuck here together.,You've got a customer.
Pull my laces tighter.,I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
He's blunt, but he's got a point.,At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
Design major.,Can we not talk about this?
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.,Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? ,Gatorade.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.,Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?,No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
He made it, hunhh?,Yeah, but at what a price.
You know.,What, your dick?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.,I never tried it.
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!,I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
What the fuck did you do that for?,Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
What?,If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.,I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
Get to work.,What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
I like to expand my horizons.,I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
I didn't think they even enforced this.,Living proof.
You're lying.,I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?,Because I'm happy.
You're happy?,I'm happy.
You're happy to get a fine?,No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
What did she say?,She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
What happened to title dictates behavior?,This is my way of spitting water at life.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?,I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.,I'll read the book.
Who eats cock?,Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.,Fuck you.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?,Could be.
What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?,This life.
This life?,Why do I have this life?
It's the same thing with Veronica.,Leave her out of this.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...,...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
Make them change.,I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.,Jesus.
Why do you say that?,Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
How do you figure?,What time did you get to work today?
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.,You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.,I know I can bench more than that!
Do I know you?,You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?,I'm her sister.
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!,Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.,I'm not dealing.
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!,With you? I don't think so.
What's that mean?,You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?,A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?,I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?,He died in the bathroom.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.,Lasagne.
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!,Actually, that's his night job.
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.,I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
The white kind.,I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.,Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
I said go ahead.,No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
The porno mags?,Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
At least they weren't lit.,I hate this fucking place.
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.,The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?,Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Do you think anyone can see us down here?,Why? You wanna have sex or something?
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?,Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
"Be there?",Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
And I actually date you?,Something wrong?
How many?,How many what?
You've slept with twelve different girls?,Including you; yes.
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?,Three.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.,Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
Yeah, right.,I'm serious...
You sucked that guy's dick?,Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?,Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
How many dicks have you sucked?!,Let it go...
Well...?,Something like thirty-six.
A few?,...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.,Thirty-seven. I just can't...
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?,Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.,What time do you get finished?
Would you let me explain...,Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital.,I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.,Scumbag. What are you doing?
Is he staying here?,He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
He really wants to play metal?,He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that.
Sure. How about the beach?,I like the way you think.
You hope what feels good?,I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.,Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
The guy ain't here yet.,You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
I have first dibs.,Says who?
Like hell you are!,I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Work!  Don't say that word, man.,Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.,C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
Did you catch that thunder?,No way, death-breath, that was too intense for thunder.  C'mon let's rock an' roll.
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.,That woulda been cool.
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.,I admit, I can be bought.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.,If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
A monkey?,So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
You know how the airlines are.,Bags?
Tucker?,Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
The money!,WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?,I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
Forget me.  If you can, get away.,Would you?
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?,Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
I'm going with you.,Not on that leg.
How're ya feeling?,Fine, I guess...
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?,Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Can I count as fast as I like?,Sure you can.
Four...five...,Nice and easy...
Do you see them yet?,Patience my love, patience.
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. ,Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
Enough.,Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.,After the funeral I just had to leave.
I know...,I don't think you do.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.,I don't expect you to understand.
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.,No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.,He doesn't want my help.
Gabe!?,What are you doing here!?
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.,How'd you get up here?
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.,I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.,I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
I can't believe you just said that.,Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?,Sure, just give it back when you're done.
What was God thinking when he built this place?,If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
Gabe are you alright?,For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
No luck?,Next time, date only basketball players.
Gabe!,Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
Reach up!  Do it!,Don't let me fall!
What about you?!,RUN, DAMMIT!!
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.,There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.,I burned it.
What the fuck you mean you burned it?,Never could save a thing.
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?,No, he's gone.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!,What are you talking about?
On top of the peak.,It looks like a winding route.
Got to be Comb Bluff.,Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.,<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.,What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
What's the delay?,Let's move your ass in there!!
You got what we need?,No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
No names, this is an open line!,I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.,We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
Appreciate it.,You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight.,I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.,We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.,There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!,Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.,Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
Been punished, yeah?,I've been cured.
Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened to you, my boy? Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away from his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off Alex's clothes. They look at each other.,The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
No, my health doesn't allow it.,And you, sir?
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!,Thank you, sir.
My wife... Alex freezes.,... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?,No. She's dead!
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.,Phoned some friends, sir?
But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.,I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
Hi, hi, hi there, at last we meet.,What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
So this is the young man?,How do you do, sir?
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.,I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.,Alex.
Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?,Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.,That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.,Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.,New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
Not tonight - not this nochy.,Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
Not feeling too bad now are you?,No, sir, I feel really great.
Good evening, my boy.,Hi, hi, hi there, my little droogies.
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?,My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
Surprise?,One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.,Keeping fit then?
No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?,Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
What do I want?,Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
I wanna be sick.,You wanna be sick?
You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?,Alexander de Large, sir.
Blue eyes?,Blue eyes, yes, sir.
Have you ever had any mental illness?,No, sir.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.,What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.,You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
Are you referring to the background score?,Yes!!!
How are you feeling today?,Fine. Fine.
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.,Oh.
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.,Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.,That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.,Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
Good. What do you want?,Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
I hope so. Is that the end then?,Yes.
How many did I get right?,It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.,Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
Father, I have tried, have I not?,You have, my son.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?,You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.,That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.,Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
Sir, 655321, sir.,Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
Yeah... Pete the English.,The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
Hullo, son, how are you?,Are you feeling better?
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.,I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.,No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
Shall we go to my office?,Thank you.
No, no way, I couldn't take that...,Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
...he's two floors below you.,In my office?
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.,Of course.
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.,I think...
What?  What did you say?,I said.  Get the gun.  Out.  Of my fucking <u>face.</u> Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
I picked up a tail.,Federal?
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?,No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
You guys been holding hands?,Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.,Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
I'm in town for a short time.,Try?
I brought you flowers.,What am I gonna do with flowers?
You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?,Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.,What's he sayin'?
You're kidding me.,I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
...oh God, don't shoot me...,...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, <u>up</u>...
He'll keep calling.,Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...,...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
How long you think this'll take?,Twenty-four minutes.
Oh?  How long you been doing this?,Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?,I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.,You always stutter?
I think he's dead.,No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
Uh, look...why don't you just take the car...,...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  Get in the fucking car.
Max.,It's not me.
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.,Okay, try it now.
What are you doing?,It's a mess.
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...,I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
Are you breathing?,Yes.
Music.,Play music.
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.,How can you kill him like that?
Get rid of 'em.,How?
Lenny?  You're an asshole.,Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
Another collateral.,What?
Collateral damage.,I don't understand...
Vincent?,Yes, Max?
But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?,I'm...what?  Sorry?
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?,I never learned jazz.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...,I'm not catching a melody.
Let him go, Vincent.,You mind?  I'm working here.
Don't even think you're walking away from me.,<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
Show up for <u>what?</u>,She's in the hospital.
Limos, huh?,Don't start.
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.,Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.,Yeah?  What happened?
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...,What happened?
How long have you been a hit man?,Why?
Yeah, that.,Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
Head towards Union Station.,What's at Union Station?
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...,You're full of shit.
And you believe me...?,What'd they do?
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?,None of your business.
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...,Slow down.
You're going too fast.,But you know what?  Nothing matters, anyway.  We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  Right? Yeah.  That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro.  And I never saw it that way...
The sound of love.,Excuse me?
That's love.,Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
I was only going one way.,Drop me off here!
Look, I'm sorry --,Just drop me off.
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.,I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.,Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.,Do you still ride?
Not for years.,So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
I bit the bastard's nose off.,You bit someone's nose off?
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.,Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.,What is?
It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.,You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?,You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.,Do they have a secret handshake?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.,Believe you about what?
You want something to drink?,Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.',Pretty scary, huh?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?,Never heard of him.
What are you doing?,Getting rid of my hub!
Shoot.,It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
So what's the question?,How is it possible?
Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.,Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.,Realized what?
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?,There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.,Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.,Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...,Jerry, I --
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.,Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
Did you kill my father?!,No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
Love at first sight?,I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
I believe you.,You do?
Geronimo is down.,It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
I love you, too.,Now she tells me.
Do I know you?,Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
Thank you.,You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
Can I ask you something?,A dog bit it.
And you have no idea where he lives?,You've asked me that one three times.
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.,I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?,Yes, that's right.
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.,If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
Ah, your psychotic is here.,Not today...
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.,I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.,This doesn't make sense.
You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy.,No.  Not yet.
Agent Lowry.,Wasn't my idea.
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.,Your call.  Have a good night.
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.,And Jonas?
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.,Where do you think Jerry is?
There's no plug to pull.,What?
Dr. Arroway --,Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.,So?
I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.,I'm willing to take that risk.
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --,You're --
You know why I'm here.,It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.,I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.,The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.,David --
... could it be a nested code of some sort?,You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...,What?  Why?
What is it?  What's happened?,We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.,Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
What?,As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...,... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.,Thank you?
And?,No primer.
J39 Z186...?,Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.,Put it on speakers.
Ellie.  Pulsar?,1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
Can't we get rid of them?,It's a civilian facility.
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.,I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
You're not real.  None of this is.,That's my scientist.
So who -- what -- are you?,Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
So we passed some kind of test?,You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
Am I one... or many?,The librarian... or the library...?
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.,You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
That isn't the way it works.,But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
It's time to go home now.,No.  Please.
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?,I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
A machine.  But a machine that does what?,That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
What's that?,Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
What are you talking about?  It's over.,Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?,I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?,We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
I'd say this is slightly different.,Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
I thought you were here because you want to go.,I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
Ellie.  Arroway.,Peter Valerian.
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...,'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.,Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.,What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
But what about your research -- ?,This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
You sonofabitch.,That is true.  But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things, I'd follow you anywhere... but the truth is I don't think you want the company.  Be honest, El.  There's nowhere you'd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe.  And call me crazy, but I just can't compete with that... I'm sorry.
Someone tell me this is really happening.,It's really happening.
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?,That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.,And where exactly does that put your position...?
'My father's house has many mansions.',Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.,Now you know.
Did you love him?,Yes.  Very much.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.,Something like that.
I read your book.,Really.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.,I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?,I don't follow.
... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?,An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?
What...?,I'm sorry.
Ellie, what is it?,I'm sorry -- I can't --
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.,Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.,Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.,How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.,Git your shovel and git to work.
You don't take another man's place, boy.,It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.,We work down in the ditch?
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.,I'll make it a dollar.
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.,Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.,Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?,Here, Mom.
What went wrong?,Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.,Gotta go, Arletta.
We saw the broads.,Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
What's all this dirt in the yard?,I... I... I...
Please! Please!,Git to work!
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...,No, Boss! I won't. I won't. I got my mind right. I got it right, Boss. Please don't hit me no more.
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.,I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.,I'll give you fifty cents.
Borrowin' or payin' back?,Borrowin'.
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.,He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...,I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
Oh lookit that brunette.,Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
A cold drink? Okay?,Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?,Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.,Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...,That's what you're gonna have to do.
Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.,The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.
Where'd the road go?,That's it. That's the end.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?,Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.,We got it locked in the sock.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...,We ain't goin' nowhere.
What you mean, Luke?,I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
But, Luke...,Take it easy, Drag.
Like I always do?,Thass right. Just play it...
Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.,Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.,You just said he could eat anything.
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.,You jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. When it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.,Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.,Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Kick a buck.,Damn.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.,Well, how far didya get?
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?,Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
He'll never make it.,What are you talking about?
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.,You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?,None of your fucking business.
I hate this...,Only kidding!
Now look what you did.,What did I do?
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.,Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?,Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.,Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.,No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?,Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.,You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.,Stop acting like a silly little fag!
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?,Tell her about <u>what</u>?
Who are you?,Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.,You already made the delivery?
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.,Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?,Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.,You're calling me a crank?
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.,Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.,Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
How do you know that?,Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?,It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
I'm going to put a guard on your door.,One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.,I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.,Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?,He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.,You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...,It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
What's that siren?,One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.,They get fan letters...
I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!,He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.,I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!,Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?,Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...
Okay.,We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone.  I know you won't mention it.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?,Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?,Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!,Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.,Helen... excuse me, we...
There was no sperm.,The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.,What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
Sergeant?,Yessir.
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.,I know.  Get out here.
So what have we got?,It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...,I gotta have Ruben, and a...
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...,Or the F.B.I.?
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?,We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.,What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?,She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.,I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.,And her husband? What was he?
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.,Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.,I'd like to go back. James...
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.,When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
Please finish your story.,The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?,Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
Are we allowed to park here?,No.
Do you live here? With Seagrave?,I live in my car. This is my workshop.
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.,It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.,You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project.,Where are you?
Do we have to talk about this?,I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.,We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.,Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes. 
Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication.,Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.,Then, you should call.
It was just a little going-away gesture.,I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
What's up with you?,Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
Just go ahead and tell us.,There's nothing to tell.
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.,Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
What do you think of this one?,I'd have to see it on.
Yeah, everything's under control.,What about the engagement party?
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.,Do you think I should?
Fuck me.,What's the matter?
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...,I'll be back before you can say souffle.
My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.,Wow.   Congratulations.
Tell us every detail.,You've only known Jake a few months.
I haven't had a crush since I was,When did you start smoking?
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.,Mom, please.
Must you walk so quickly?,It's good exercise, Mom.
I'm really not that hungry.,Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.,To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
Do you mind if I call you Letitia?,Letty.
Chair, cup and ball.,Terrific.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?,By color.
What if it's got a pattern?,Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
Guess.,The left one.
We'll get caught.,No rounds for another three hours.
A daisy for the lady.,The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?,Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.,Break up?    They wish.
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?,I better make a list.
Where to?,I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
Hey.,It's sex time.
This must be Beast.,That's Mr. Beast to you.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?,You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.,Coming.
Something like that.,When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
Silly?   Silly am I?,Michael, take it easy.
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.,Good going. I knew you could do it.
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?,Oh, ok.   Maybe.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.,Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.
Yeah.,You just need to get more organized. L
I hope it wasn't something I did.,Something you did?
Yes, I suppose so.,This has been really difficult, this whole thing. 
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.,Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
No, you've done a perfect job.,So, what do you say, Let?
You can tell me anything.  Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?,No...
Have you been seeing another teacher?,No.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.,I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.,I'm glad you're doing well.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.,What does that mean?
I need someone to work on budget projections.,Office work?
How's it look?,Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
Agent Hadley.,Do you know who this is?
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.,I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.,Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.,They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?,I thought you wanted Zammito?
Hey man, you can't do that!,What?   This?
Oui.,My number's going to show up on his bill!
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.,You don't trust me?
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--,-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.,When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.,I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.,Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
And?,And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
Uh, no --,You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?,I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
But you were there?,Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
What kind of business?,Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!,You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.,No problem.
Because you're the closest.,I'm not any closer than you are.
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.,You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
This is Zero.,Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.,You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
Does it really matter what I say?,I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
I've got a way with people.,I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.,We had a deal.
I just thought that--,-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.,Hector, don't interrupt me.
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.,Oh, I'm sorry.
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.,Good song though.
What hotel?,The Holiday Hotel.
What room number?,I don't know.     I didn't look.
The map said to go left.,Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
What do we do?,I was told to take what we have and go.
They don't have a wine list.,Oh, then we will have the house wine.
What about transportation?,You can use my car.
No, I didn't.,Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
They don't serve wine here.,What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?,Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.,It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.,Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.,How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
How about Canada?,What are we going to do, take a taxi?
-- I want to be Elvis.,It's my idea.
This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.,The baseball is mine.
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!,And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
Fuck you, grease-ball!,Fuck me?   Fuck you!
Mr. Zammito?,Uh huh.
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.,I don't know what you're talking about.
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.,How?
No shit?,The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
He speaks about himself in the third person?,Feel free to correct him if you want.
You're not helping.,Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --,-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.,What does arresting us get them?
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.,Thanks.
You ever hear of jet lag?,Take a nap.
Casandra. Old girlfriend?,Something like that.
She seems pleasant enough.,She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?,You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Okay.    Okay.,I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
Do you think you are a real master?,Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.,I'll never live as a thief!
Hello.  What is your name?,Long.
Please sit.,I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.,Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
This spells trouble.,I have a guest.
But you're just like the characters in the stories.,Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
Please.,Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.,You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
About you and Li Mu Bai?,Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
No, really?,His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.,I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Where is he now?,Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!,How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Let's end this here.,Only the sword will settle this.
What do you want?,What I've always wanted, to teach you.
The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.,All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.
You shouldn't have come.,With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.,Give me back my comb.
Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer.,Let them look.
You were enlightened?,No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.,Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!,Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
She needs direction... and training.,She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.,It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
You think Jade Fox will show up?,She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?,Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
But the sword could be in his compound.,Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.,You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.,Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
Talent. Hi.,Care for a hot dog?
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.,Annie, I need a file.
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?,Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass.",You don't say.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...,Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
They couldn't do anything for me.,How 'bout the morgue?
You sorta looked like you might need my help.,This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?,Out.  Now.  I gotta work.
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.,Who?
Mister Funboy.,Mister Funboy lives there?
What's going on...?,A remembrance.  A closure.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?,I think he's yours, now.
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.,You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
What's goin' on, Elly?,I went to see a friend of mine.
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...,Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
Neither.,Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?,Shelly?
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.,Fine with me.
Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?,No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.,Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
I'm Kathryn.,Annette Harrison.
Did you know Sebastian well?,You might say that.
I have his journal.,You what?
Nothing.,Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
Got a boyfriend back home?,No.
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.,I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
Excuse me. Excuse me!,You talking to me?
The Fountainhead.,Great book.
Romantic? He rapes her.,That's a matter of opinion.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.,Thank you.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.,What? Another letter from your friend?
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.,Why not?
That's repulsive.,What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.,I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
It was fine.,I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
And that's a bad thing?,I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
That's also none of your business.,Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.,What?
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.,Wait, don't hang up.
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.,Okay.
What?,"I actually feel good about myself?"
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.,Yes it does.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.,I do not.
Because I'm in love with you.,I thought you said we were going to be friends.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.,That's not fair.
You really want to know?,Yes.
Hi.,Hi.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --,It was perfect.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.,What are you saying?
Why aren't you understanding?,I love you.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.,I'm sorry about that.
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.,Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
Outstanding.,Don't think it's not going to cost you.
What are the boys like?,Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
I'm in the bath, mom.,Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
See that wasn't so bad.,It was nothing.
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.,Why?
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.,You'd do that for me?
Who is it?,It's Kathryn.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.,Well... not exactly.
Cecile, you had an orgasm.,I did?
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.,I am?
What are you doing?,Just taking your photo.
I look terrible.,Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.,Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
But -,I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
Am I suppose to be this sore?,For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
Where are you going?,I'm taking a shower.
I think that's all the time we have for today.,Same time next week?
No it doesn't. I see right through you.,You do?
Nudie pictures, what do you think?,Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Where is she?!,I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
Yeah?,It's Kathryn.
What's wrong?,It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.,Outstanding.
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.,What?
You can put it anywhere.,Even there?
Loser.,Blow me.
You would not believe what--,Shhh.
No.,Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.,What's your plan of attack?
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.,I hate it too.
Shut up.,What's your problem?
Nothing.,She's really getting to you, isn't she?
Tell me all the details.,It was... Fantastic.
No, tell me.,It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.,Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
Ronald?,Not that it's any of your business but yes.
To my triumph, of course.,Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.,And if I don't?
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.,I think you have your answer.
You're too kind.,How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
Ronald? That's crazy.,I know. She's so young and he's so -
Let me get that for you.,Oh please. I can't have you do that.
She's out.,Do you know when she'll be back?
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -,Yes, you already did.
Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.,How will I get to her?
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?,What are you talking about?
Ronald, I'm sorry.,You bastard!
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.,What do you mean?
Did you ever make a wish?,Oh, lots of times.
The Farren house,Do you know the people?
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.,I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
Where'd you get this, darling?,It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.,I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
I know that.,That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.,I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today  let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,,Times have changed.
Something's haywire,,What do you mean?
Where did you get it?,Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
What's funny?,That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
I thought you were with Amy.,No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
That's the Farren house.,Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.,Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
Where did you mail them?,I'll show you.
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.,I didn't forget.
Can't you tell me later?,But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me.
Now Amy,It's true.
Irena. But who are you?,I'm your friend.
But where is that?,I can not tell you.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?,No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
I shall wear it in my hair!,Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
You mustn't be afraid.,But she's dead!
A lady threw it to me.,Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
It's a pretty ring.,I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.,But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.,Will you come soon?
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.,I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.,It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
Bad luck to see death in the snow.,But what happened to the little deer?
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me  always!,Who is she?
The Headless Horseman --,Why hasn't he got a head?
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.,Good.
What?,Don't you hear it?
And does he kill people?,No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!,Yes...yes, that's true.
Good night, mother, good night.,Good night...Barbara...
Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?,Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.,Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.,That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.,Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?,Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.,Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.,Yeah but they looked cool...
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.,It's not just in my head.
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?,Nearly four.
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?,No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.,I get a little bloated sometimes.
Do you really need these?,Only to see.
Can't you get contacts?,No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.,What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.,Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.,What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?,They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?,There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
So did you do it?,Did I kill him? Of course not!
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.,I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
What did he say?,I think he called you beautiful.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.,No you don't, believe me.
You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?,No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
Shit, I guess I missed work.,Frida, Carlton's dead.
Get rid of him!,Okay, I gotta go.
Holy shit, I don't know.,Did you get rid of Mark?
DON'T call the police.,Why not? There's been a murder.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.,You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
Why the fuck would you do that?,I could smell another woman on him.
You expecting someone?,No.
Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.,Tell them you'll meet them outside.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.,So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
Fall in love.,I think I already have.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.,Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
I know.,So you're Grant's secretary?
I do development for TV movies.,Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.,I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.,I can't help it, it smells so good.
OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?,Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
Where'd you get the bike?,I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.,Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.,My bra is my biggest supporter.
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?,Did you change your hair?
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.,Very well then. Is that all?
You busted me.,Are you following me?
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.,No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
Oh, it's nothing.,No really, I love knowing what people read.
My mom used to get PMS too.,Used to? Did it stop finally?
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.,Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
A lot of people don't wear underwear.,Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
What are they for?,Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
What's wrong?,Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.,Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
No, why?,He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.,Interesting possibility.
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.,No, my bite's a lot worse.
Is that how you feel?,Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
You know, I've never seen your cat.,I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.,No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.,Worse than this?
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.,What about... those guys... I might have...
That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.,Oh, I see... interesting theory.
I ate a guy last night.,And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?,No, I said it was our first date.
You heard about Carlton Fraser?,Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.,She's just so... pathetic.
You want her sheets?,We can just take this pillowcase.
He was found a few blocks away.,Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.,That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
What?,And you think I'm sick?
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.,Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
You think mafia hit?,Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.,Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.,What makes her think that?
Thanks.  Just some pills.,Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
Sell maps?,What of?
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.,Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
How long have you been here?,Maybe ten minutes...  Thats strange.
In there.,Just like that?
Good evening, sir.,Yes.  This way.
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?,Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
Im your new assistant.,I didnt requisition a secretary.
It seems fine.,<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.,Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
Why give yourself up?,I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
Don't know that either.,Don't know much, do you?
They didn't have faces.,What?
You see it?,Yes.
A book of delusions.  Anything else?,But I...
What are you doing?,I have to go...
What is it?,We are...  living in their dreams...
How do you know I'm innocent?,Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?,They're dead, John.
Holy cow.,We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
What's with her?,Don't worry about it.
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.,... Alright.
Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.,Well it's a last minute change.
.. Nothing.,Great.
Oh... I'm fired?,Yeah.
You're fired.,Fine...
Die, you pond scum!,I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.,I can't believe he'd do this.
Where's the girl?,She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
Nightmare...,Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.,Like how?
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?,It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...,What about containment, Alan?
What's with the cameras?,Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
What are you gonna do?,I'm going to kill him.
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.,Bob...
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.,He's only doing what you told him to.
Are you threatening me?,Sort of... Yeah.
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?,I was gonna do something with Joan.
And who's gonna find out?,The government
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.,I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.,Choices?
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.,So what do we do?
At a press conference.,What?
Gimme a quarter.,What?
What do you mean you made it all up?,We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
And it's proving quite effective...,Does it make the cars any better?
Something like what...,Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
The Fidelity nonsense...,All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
... Sometimes they do.,Yeah... Sometimes they do.
You ever think back to how you started.,What?
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.,Certainly.
What are you staring at?,Uh...
You bet.,I'm outta here.
What?,Since when do you care about the homeless?
I care about the homeless.,Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
Look.  If there was some mistake...,There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
Oh... Yeah.,Mind if I sit down?
When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.,They asked me to help.
Where are you going?,Home.
Where's home?,Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
You sure this goes somewhere?,Truman used it all the time.
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.,I don't mind.
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...,I'm not Bill Mitchell.
It was okay?,It was inspirational.
Well I guess...,Yeah... Bedtime.
It could be fun.,Yeah... It could be fun.
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...,Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?,We're working on it.
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.,We're doing our best, sir.
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?,Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?,Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.,We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.,I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.,Maybe.
It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go.,We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.,I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!,They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.,Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.,You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...,Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
You fired that shot, didn't you?,No, sir.
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?,Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.,Will do.
I don't know.  I don't get it.,Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!,Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.,I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.,I couldn't stop myself.
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?,So much the better.
Mr. Keating!,I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.
Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?,I'm sorry.  I, we
Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.,Good.  We're very excited about him.  He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.
Who else was involved in this?,No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?,My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
It's all right, Chet.,It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?,No.
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.,Huh?
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.,Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
But I love you.,You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
God, if Chet found out he'd...,Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.,I didn't know you taught.
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.,A madman.
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!,A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!,I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
A sweaty-toothed madman,A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.,Okay.
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!,You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!,Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
All right!  What'd she say?,I don't know.
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?,Father, I wasn't disputing you.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?,Yes sir.
You know me, always taking on too much.,Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
Father!,Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!,Yes sir.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?,My brother went here.
What?,Nothing.
What is it then?,I... I just don't want to come.
So?,So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.,That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
But if he said no before then...,Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
Er  No.,No?  What do you mean 'no'?
Neil, how are you gonna do this?,Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.,They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Oh..,Oh. 
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...,Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!,Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!
Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?,I will be with thee straight.
Chicken shit.  Where were we?,Yea, art thou there?
Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.,Which question is that?
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.,I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?,I told you...
Now look what you did!,I saved your life is what I did!
Unless you collected on the insurance...,What are you people talking about?
I'm not rich people.,Well, you sure do a good imitation.
Yeah you did...,Right... You have a boat.
Like cattle...,You're saying they can think?
What's the matter?,The quiet...
It's not them...it's it...,What?
You want ME to go up there?,Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...,No...
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.,That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?,Seafood salad.  You ever operate a jet ski?
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...,Joey...
What the hell does that mean?,Like Mamooli's country...
Check it out!,Hey! You hear me? Come out!
What's there to think about?? That THING back there...,There ain't no thing here!! No thing!! There's you him and me!! Got it! You him and...
She fucked us both.,Yeah.
Fucking women, man...,I know...
You want 'em?,Damn right!
That's mustard!,What?
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.,Good... Pass the beer.
Who's going?,We're all going.
Nick's going?,Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
It is not!,It is too! Now you passed it!
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.,You're full of shit.
Who's full of shit?,You're full of shit!
They did too!,Jesus, it's freezing!
Tell him, Vince!,Well... you remember Cynthia?
You don't!,I do!!!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!,She does not!
Whee-uu!,Jesus!
Fucking A.,Worse since she talked to who?
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.,Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
See, I'm going home.,Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?,I came to see Merle.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?,Yeah.
I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.,Everybody love Linda.
How was huntin'?,Oh. Fine.
Those fuckin' niggers. This time I'm going to eat balls!... You ever try 'em?,Naw.
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!,Who's got the ammo?
Holy shit!,Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks?
Hey, Nick...,Nick, we don't know where Sal is... Nick, Angela won't tell us.
Where's it gone?,Inside, Vince.
Nick! Hey, Nick!  Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?,Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
Kind of. You didn't know?,Sal's alive???
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???,Nick, she won't say why.
Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.,Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
Linda...,Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
I don't know what we've been waiting for!,I don't know! I don't know either!
But --,It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
Does this... I mean, how does this job work out?,Oh, it's great. Fine.
You're going hunting?,What?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?,I don't know.
Playing?,We... Three bullets.
You can do it, Sal.,No. No, no.
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?,Merle, I wanna go home!
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!,There's Vince!
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.,Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
Nick, he just came back.,From Nam?
What'd he say?,Pow.
Pow?,Pow.
It's ahead, by the tree.,It's ahead, Vince.
Tomorrow I go with Vince.,Hunt with Vince?
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.,What are you, God?
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!,Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
Forget Sal.,What do you mean?
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.,Forget Sal?
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.,With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
No way. No fucking way!,I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
No. No way!,When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!,How much? How much do you wanna bet?
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.,Then lemme have 'em.
No.,What do you mean, no???
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.,I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
Great. That's great.,That's my plan.
See you Monday.,See you Monday.
What's that noise?,What?
Did you get one?,No.
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?,Yeah!
Well, who'd you get married to?,Aw, it's a long story!
No!,Never one.
You're full of shit!,Yeah.
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?,Sure.
What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!,You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words.,I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.
Up I would say... What would you say?,Up.
Down I would say... What would you say?,Down.
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.,What'cha got, Bennett?
That's him.  Simon Doucet.,Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
Yeah?,Wade's here.
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.,Wade did a little reminiscing.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.,He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
I think he wants more than your cookies.,Kimberly!
Who is it?,Avon Lady!
Funny guy.,Fuck you - fuck you.
I want to see my wife and kid.,Later.  I want Doucet first.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.,He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.,Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
I'm wasting time.,You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.,I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.,You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.,Keep 'em busy.
I'm ready.,But Sergeant...
I have to go home, Sanchez.,Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
See those guys?,Technothugs.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.,Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
Wanna come?,My insurance won't cover it.
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.,Pass.
Can I ask you something?,Yes.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?,Trust me.  You don't want to know.
Why?,I was set up.
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?,'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.,We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.,Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
Wanna try?,No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
You're not pregnant, are you?,No, sir.
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.,What else did he get?
What's this?,We're partners, aren't we?
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.,...Have you been drinking?
Yeah.,This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
You okay?,Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?,Hospital food.
No.  I want to be with you.,No you don't.
You all right?,Yeah.
Yes.,My granddad was a policeman.
I'm going to be a policeman.,What's your name?
William Simpson.  I like Willy.,Good to know you, Willy.
Bye.  Thanks.,Remember, get the seat fixed.
Hi.,Hi.
I'll take it.,No -- that's for me to do.
Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.,We will --
Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.,Jabez! Careful --
Jabez -- ?,I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
You're lying.,Lying to you -- Why should I?
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.,That's my problem, Belle.
Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!,Why? It don't hurt.
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?,No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
What's that, sir?,Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!,It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.,No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
Mama!,Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
Granny, when do we move to the new house?,Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?,Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.,Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
What do you want?,Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
She couldn't be gone!,But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.
Stevens!,Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --,No, Stone!
-- in gold.,I'd like to know where you'd get it....
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!,Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
It's mine?,That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
No, no! Give it to me!,A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?,You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
Are they all as -- small -- as that?,Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?,I'm through with you.
What -- what's on your mind?,You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.,They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?,Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!,There's no joy in it for me.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?,Well, I --
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --,Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?,Camomile tea!
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.,Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
Jabez!,Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
Mary--,Jabez ...
I'll get the doctor.,No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
You'll never change -- will you?,Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!,Oh -- Jabez.
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --,I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --,What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.,Isn't that your own fault?
Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?,It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!,Jabez!
"There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil.",Consarn the consarn --
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!,Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
Well ... make him keep quiet.,And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?,I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!,It don't matter!
Hello, Sheriff.,Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.,Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?,Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!,Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!,Hullooo!
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.,I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
Me?,Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.,H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?,Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!,I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
I wanted to give it all to the church.,My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
I can't be honest with them.,Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.,Mind if I play some tunes?
How 'bout some Christmas music?,That is Christmas music.
So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms.  Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?,It's corny, but I could live with it.
What's happening?,They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
The police...?,John.
John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?,How about his job?
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...,Tell that to Mr. Takagi.
John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...,Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...,That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
You're very perceptive.,Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?,The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you.
He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.,He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --,If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
'Asian Dawn Movement?',I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.,This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
You...you're an American?,Only if New Jersey counts.
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!,Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --,No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
Yeah.  How'd you know?,I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
How do you know?,I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.,I'm ahead of you...partner.
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --,Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
They way you drive, I can see why.,I...I shot a kid.
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --,-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --,-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
Gene -- you smilin'?,No.  I never smile any more.
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?,Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.,They're not after you, they're after me.
It looks like a whole roast.,Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge.
Yeah.  A lot of guns.,Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
Hello.  Hello, Leon.,Hello, Sonny.
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?,I'm really shakey.
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.,Yeah.  It was terrible.
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.,You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
So... that sure is something.,Yeah.  So how are you?
I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?,I'm sorry...
Would you do something for me? Please?,What?
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...,All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Well... I don't know if I have or not.,Do you still want the operation?
What kind of things, Leon?,Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
He needed money?  For the operation for you?,It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
Who's this?,This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
You alone, or you got confederates?,I'm not alone.
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.,Call me Sonny-boy.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?,They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...,So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.,... armed robbery ...
Calm down, you're not ...,Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
He wanted to kill me!,It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
Sonny, be reasonable!,I want to see my wife.  I want you to bring her down here.
What the fuck do you want?,They were ...
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...,Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
Yeah?,We're bringing in your wife...
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.,He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!,It's all we got.
Where's the back door?,It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.,They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
You like me?,Sure - we like you.
You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... One time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.,I'm sorry.
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.,We like you, too.
Mister Mulvaney?,Yeah?
What is it, Sam?,Everything's all right?  You okay?
You all right?,Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
Hey, girls -- I was on television...,What about Howard?
Did you always call him Junior.,Yeah.
No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!,Pure?
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?,You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
Ah, Jesus...,Let's go, Sonny.
... The bodies out the door.,I want him to think that.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...,What kind of a deal?
You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.,Wyoming.
Sonny -,Yeah ...
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.,Get over there!
There it is, Sal.  Sal?,I'm here.
I don't want him.,What can he do, he's clean...
Okay - you got your one.,You follow my car. 
I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it.,We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?
Oh - Maria!,Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.,What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.,I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
Did Pop come down?,No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
Robbing a bank.,I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?
What about, ah, non-union occupations?,Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.,Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source.

Captain Rob came back?,Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?,You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.
If you have to ask, you don't know.,Yeah, that's why I asked.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!,Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?,He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.,How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.,I don't know who we are anymore.
Hey there goes Principal Collins!,He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?,Right.
What?,That's the one I wanted.
You take her.,No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.

So, when can we do it?,Tomorrow night?
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...,LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
He's going to be in jail for a long time.,Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
Do I know you?,Duh. I'm in your class at school.
How much homework is there?,That's the downside. There is none.
Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.,Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?,He passed away three years ago.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!,It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?,We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.,So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.,Will that be on the midterm?
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.,How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
Times two.,I think you'll make a good teacher.
And, take some more pictures.,Wow, you are smart.
The evidence of what?,Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
So the chest is still out there somewhere.,Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.,I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.

I can assure you...,Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.,I'm sorry Gurney.
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.,Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
No, but many consider my training valuable.,I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?,I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
You know the ancient tongues?,I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?,Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death.  It's a maker...
Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?,My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.,Your Reverence.
Don't touch my mother...,Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.,Where are we do you think?
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh..., Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
Run!,I can't... I can't.
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?,Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
Man-carved steps.,Yes...
Are you a Fremen?,I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
You've worn a stillsuit before?,No.
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?,No one. It... seemed the proper way.
Long live the fighters!,Long live the fighters!
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?,Not all of them... I know which ones will.
Did they try and fail?,They tried and died....  Jessica!
Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.,Stop him, Jessica!
Uh, beg to differ.,"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!,Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.,I predict we're lost.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.,I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge.
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.,Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!,Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
Eddie, what kind of movie is this?,Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.,Ah, so I pull the strings!
Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?,BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!,Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
Goodbye!  Goodbye!,So how'd we do?
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?,Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.,Eddie, you screwed up.
In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.,Really?
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...,Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?,This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?,Huh?
Eddie, this is quite a scene.,I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
Why are you here??,Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?,Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.,It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?,Soon, Bela... Soon.
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?,No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?,That's great.  Let's do a take.
And, cut...,Eddie, how was I?
Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.,I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?,I don't know.  Where?
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!,You mean a Tesla coil?
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!,Don't you want a second take, for protection?
I don't understand.,I made it up.  It's horseshit!
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?,I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?,Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
No!  A horror movie star!,Boris Karloff!?
No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.,Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!,Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?,Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!,Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.,But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.,That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
That's right...,I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.,Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.,Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.,Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
Mr. Wood?!,Hruphh...?
Yeah...?,Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?,You could say that --
And PERFECT.  CUT!,"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
I like to think so.,That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.,Really?  Was the third act too intense?
Hey!  You're not eatink.,Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.,Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
My eyes are killink me.,Don't worry.  We're almost there.
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.,My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!,Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
Is there a script?,Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
Lugosi?,Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
Isn't he dead?,No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
OUR picture?,Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?,Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!,Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"!,Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!
Georgie, what's with the stag footage??  You said you were cutting in <u>establishing shots</u>!,I did.  I established some tits and ass.
I got married last night.,Oh.  Congratulations.
The marriage already ended.,Oh.  My condolences.
What are you making?,Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.,I just picked them up on the way over...
Oh.  I loved those shows!  "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" --,Yeah!  Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there.
Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.,Huh?
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?,Dynamite --
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!,Who's Dr. Tom?
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?,Yes?
No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster.",Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
I'm really sorry...,It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.,Yeah...?
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.,Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!,Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
B-but it's our money --,And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?,Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -,What if--you're vomiting?
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.,This is real, Bananahead!
Sure.,A woman wants to be pursued.
Great line.,What if Shari's the dream?
Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --,Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
Ed --,No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.,I'm not sure about the entire concept.
,What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.,Really? They were..
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?,Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him,Right, right...
So he killed himself.,Oh.
Eddie? ...,Yeah?
No. It's a mess.,Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --,Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?,No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.,No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
What's the difference?,The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.,He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
Eddie...,Mom?
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.,Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!,And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.,All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?,Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
Our what?,Our foibles, our foibles!
Are you asking me?,No, I mean...
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late.",Who's in it?
Cream rinse?,Dynamite.
Don't defend that horse's ass to me.,I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
Ha!,Okay ...
I mean bad.,Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
What are you doing?,I missed you.
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.,That's lucky.
Um...,What?
Everybody hates me!,No. Who?
There's a list.,Really? 
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?,Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.,...yeah?
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?,So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.,I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while.
You know, that would be like a great thing.,What?
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.,What is?!
Yeah. I service video equipment.,That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
I ... I'm not gonna do it.,What?
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?,Ray --
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.,Oh, Jesus.
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?,What's the dif --
Who is it?,It's me, Ed.
Hi.,You watching the ballgame?
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.,Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
What is this? What's going on, who is that?,It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?,Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.,No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
Why me?,You brought the cameras here!
You know what your problem is?,Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
Who is it?,It's Ed.
No. Two times.,What...
Oh!!,We have to stop meeting like this.
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?,Sure.
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.,You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.,Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?,Yeah, uh, just a minute
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!,Dick... Dick,..
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.,You have the key, Mr. McAllister.
You're kidding, right?,I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.,Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
Looks good to me.,Aren't you supposed to keep them?
NO, that's fine,I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.,Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.,Looks like Tim Kobza.
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.,Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!,That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?
So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?,Sporty.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.,That sounds good.
So Tracy?,Yes?
Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.,I've got an idea.
Hmm?,Walt needs to see you.
Exactly when?,I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
Which door?,I don't know. All I know is I did it I
I can't afford this stuff right now.,Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?,No, I... uh, didn't know that
Yep.,We'll let it run awhile
I was lonely.  You took advantage,Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.,What do you mean?
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.,I also like bananas.
Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.,Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.,I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
But other people can see them too.,I don't care.
She's doing this to get back at me,For what?
Who put you up to this?,Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
Thought what?,Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.,Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Can I sign yours too?,Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -,Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.
How's the left these days?,What's it to you?
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.,Till 19-fucking-70.
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?,When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
Lad, may I have a word with you?,This business, Captain?
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?,He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.,It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.,What work?
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. ,Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.,I got to write my report first.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.,What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.,What was that boyfriend's name?
Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!,Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
What happened?,Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
How's it going to look on your report?,It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
Why?,Lynn.
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.,Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.,Let's just kill them.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.,Which one are you and which one am I?
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.,He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.,<u>Lynn</u>.
She's fine.,I'm not asking you.
Are you Pierce Patchett?,I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.,What little studio?
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.,That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.,More.
Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.,He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.,I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?,Man, why do you keep asking me that?
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --,I never truck with no sissies!
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.,Believed what?
Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?,You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.,I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!,They shot him in his library.
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?,Nobody.  At least not yet.
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.,I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.,He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.,The youngest applicant by eight years.
Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer.,White's a mindless thug.
There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --,There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.,Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now.,Okay.  I'll do it.
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.,You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?,<u>Throwing me</u>?
Damnit...,What?
Glasses.,Just don't shoot me.
Listen, I think I made a mistake, too.,I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?,Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.,I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
Decorated?,With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
What are you talking about?,Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.,I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
No.,Not good enough.
It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.,Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
How was I?,Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
You sound like you mean it.,The silver screen's loss is your gain.
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.,Why not?
A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.,I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.,I know how he feels.
When?,Right now, before I back down.
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.,Officer White?
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?,Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.,You lost me, Sid.  Who?
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.,Sid, it's Vincennes.
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.,What's he doing here, Sid?
Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?,Where'd you hear that?
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?,Sid, cut the crap.  I --
What happened with the kid and Loew?,You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
Pacific Coast Bell.,This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
Was it a party?,Something like that.
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.',Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
And you were the last one to talk to him.,Yes.
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.,I'm telling you, I--
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.,So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.,You're not.
You've got it on tape?,Clear as day.
One of many people who would live a word with you.,Who are they?
Yes.,You're crazy.
I don't know what that means.,230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
I don't know what that means.,It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?,They're spooks.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.,One-twenty.
I mean did you call anyone.,Look, my wife is understandably--
What'd I tell you?,I called from a payphone!
Sorry.,You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.,How'd you have the manpower to--
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.,They come after you?
What do you think?,Looks like Detroit.
That is one ugly sunrise.,It really is.  Did you find anything?
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.,What's going on?
They're here.,Who?
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.,Why?
What the fuck?!,They shouldn't have come without calling first.
Listen to you, "directly". You're not gonna get <u>near</u> the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.,What about newspapers and magazines?
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?,The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.,What if--
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.,What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--,What are you saying?
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.,Law enforcement?
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...,With what?
Very good.,I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
What size?,Pardon?
Remain calm.,Okay.
I think she'll like this very much.,Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
I know, but--,<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.,Why?
About the accident.,I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?,Just for the criminals.
You should take this seriously.,I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
Bobby?,Yeah.
Have you been working with Rachel?,No.
He's got his priorities?,There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
It's not true.,"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
You <u>swore</u>!,I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.,I see her for business.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.,I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
Stacy, don't hang up.,Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
I know.,I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--,My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--
Good.,Stacy--
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.,That's okay.
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.,Don't count on it.
Do you like fish?,Not that much.
DePinto?,Brill.
Never.,That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--,He doesn't work that way.
How can I be sure.,I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
You're wrong.,We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
He didn't <u>give</u> me--,--otherwise we may have to--
Your shoe.,My shoe?
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!,Seat 74.
Gentlemen--,This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
Bobby--,Fuck off.
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.,L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.,That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
Robert--,Where's Stacy?
She doesn't want to talk to you.,What are you talking--
She can't talk to you right now.,Why?
You're learning a cruel lesson.,Are those my Christmas presents?
Sure, go ahead.,Really?
In your dreams.,Dad!
No.,Usually they take clothes.
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.,The blender?
That's what I want to talk to you about?,I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
Ssh!,Bobby--
They're framing me.,Why would they--
Jerry--,Listen to me.
I'm sorry, man.,No. No, it's okay.
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--,Bobby--
What is it you want?,Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
What's your opinion?,It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?,Yes sir.
It means who's side are you on?,You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?,You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
We'd have to--,Get it.
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.,Hiding something?
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.,Sir--
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.,Lyle?!
Federal Express?,For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
How'd you get in the building?,The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?,You have any idea what kind of position this--
Yes?,Puffed cheese?
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?,No.
Which stall?,Excuse me?
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.,I don't care to bargain.
That insults them.,I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
Why did you follow me yesterday?,Excuse me?
Actually, you sing.,Pardon?
What am I looking at?,See what's happening to them - the stars.
Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.,Oh my God, the others!
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.,Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Do they know them?,No, but I think I do.
Don't.,I believe you still have my book.
What do you hate most?,A lie.  What do you hate most?
This is - what is this?,It's a folk song.
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.,That day, had you followed me to the market?
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.,I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.,You will.  You will.
You're wearing the thimble.,Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
Don't leave me!,I'm just going to find things for the fire.
What kind of photographs?,Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?,Appropriate?
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -,I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Fhrer!  Il Duce.,Sorry, what's your point?
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?,I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
What did you think you were doing in his tent?,Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
What did you do?,I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.,Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
Look, either shut up, or go home.,Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still,Right.
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.,I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
Well, then ask him his name!,What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -,Very true!
What?  You and Madox?  Or you and Katharine Clifton?,What?
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.,Me?
The team is in mourning, darling.,Oh really?
I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -,Darling, for goodness' sake!
Why do you think?  About my staying?,Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.,Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?,I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
How?  How can you see anything?,Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?,No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.,Why?  Can he lay eggs?
He's Canadian.,Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.,Well then - yes.  Of course.
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -,He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
I'll probably marry him.,Really?  That's sudden.
Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?,I've been told that before.
Arguing about books.,Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -,Hey! -
There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.,I'm not sewing anything else.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.,No!
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.,I've met you before.
Why would anyone do this?,I've done this.  I've had to do this.
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.,I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.,Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?,I try not to expect you.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!,Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
Yessir.,This is making me incredibly angry.
This is wonderful!,What's he saying?
Kip?,I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!,Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.,Through a window.
The windows don't open.,Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
Meaning--,Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
Where are you at least?,I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?,He's on to something bigger.
I don't want to waste your time.,Then don't.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.,Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?,Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
You're shaking. Are you nervous?,No. Why would I be?
I've got something for you.,Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
I know.,So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.,You can't.
A film case.,That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.
He says they turned the card down.,Damn, I knew I forgot something.
What about your bags?,I never carry...baggage.
Only a week?,They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?,We're doing this together. We're partners.
I'll need that.,No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?,No. It's a down payment.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.,It was a long time ago.
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.,It's not a village. There's nothing there.
You're nervous again.,When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
We're working.,It's a party.
You can't be too careful.,Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
Be careful not to break the laser beams.,Duh.
STOP! You're making...mistake.,It's your mistake.
The big job.,There is no big job.
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--,My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
Hmmm...44 long.,I always knew you'd do the job.
Oh my god, I thought--,I'd taken the Mask?
Well...What are we doing?,You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
Peoples China Bank.,Where the money is.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.,There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
There's always a surprise.,I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.,Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.,Feeling old?
How do I look?,Like a woman of mystery.
Pulse detectors.,Charged.
Parachute.,Packed.
You shouldn't have.,Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
You have something in mind?,Call it a new tradition.
Jesus God, it's going through.,Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
Relax, don't jam it...,FUCKING THING!!!
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...,We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
He looks familiar.,That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?,We need to make the trade tomorrow.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.,Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?,Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.,This better be worth 1t.
You better not be taking on a new partner.,Suspicious, after all these years?
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.,You damn well thought wrong.
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?,It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
She's calling the shots now.,You're impressed with her, aren't you?
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.,You're giving them to me?
Where've you been?,What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.,I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
250,000?,In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.,Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.,Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
What the hell is this doing here?,It's those files you asked for.
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?,Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
There's more than one?,Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --,An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
Hi.  Donna Irving?,Yes?
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...,Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.,I'll say.  Holy moley.
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.,Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --,It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.,I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
Oh, my God.,And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
Five million dollars?,Five million dollars.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.,... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --,I told you the questions might get a little personal --
I'm sorry, Erin.,Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my kids.
You never called me back.  I left messages.,You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
Out to lunch with the girls.,Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
Come on, I'm trying to help here.,Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.
What are you doing here?,I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
What medical records?,The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?,Course I did.
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.,So you think we got 'em scared?
At least they made an offer.,That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --,I know how DNA works, Erin --
You wanna talk about --,<u>No</u>.
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.,And that's what caused the contamination?
For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them.  That was his job.,No shit.
Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.,We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?,No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
Whoa.  No shit.,It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.,And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?,Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.,It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?,Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --,Erin, it's just a meeting.
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --,<u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is.
When?  Where?,Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
Morning!,Erin?  What are you --
I don't know what to say.,Say you were wrong.
I was wrong.,Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.,You see your office?
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.,Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
How many counts?,Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.
I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.,Did he say why?
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.,And ...?
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.,Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?,Have you been to the water board?
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.,How come you're not eating?
PG& -- Are you sure?,Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
Yeah.,Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.,You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
She's one of the sick people?,Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.,Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
Annabelle Daniels.,Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
Well, hello to you, darlin'.,What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different.  Let's start over.  My name's George.  What's yours?,Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.,Ten?
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.,You got a little girl?
No.,C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
Cause I don't even know you.,Yeah, and whose fault is that?
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?,Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
You're around every afternoon?,Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
You're not nothing, Erin.,Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.,Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?,Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
What's going on?  What are you doing?,Thinking.
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.,I can't leave my job, George.
They up?,Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
How long's this whole thing gonna take?,I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.,What's going on?
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?,Yes.  It's called accountability.
I am not talking to you, bitch.,<u>Excuse me</u>?
What?,I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
It'll be fine, yeah.,Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.,Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
Who's Baxter?,He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
It was .... the Emperor ....,The Emperor?
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....,Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
My lord.,Come in, Admiral.
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.,Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
He'll learn.,He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.,You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.,The boy is our last hope.
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?,Growls a reserved greeting.
Barks a blue streak.,What's wrong with him?
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.,Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
Barks his concern.,No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
Barks at his master.,What happened?
We should have stayed and finished them off.,Barks his agreement.
Mine, mine.,Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.,I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
... I told you, I'm not hungry.,Patience.  It's time to eat.
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.,It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?,Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.,Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.,Then I'll see you in Hell.
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?,Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
Sir, I was wondering ...,Sit down, and shut up!
I think we're in trouble.,If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
You, too, golden rod.,I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.,Han, we need you here.
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.,No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
Hey!  Someone's still in here.,Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
I do not!,Try and control this ...
What'd you have in mind for your next move?,The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.,You keep logs?  My, how organized.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.,Never heard of that system.
You look silly.,You look great.
Has Threepio turned up yet?,Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.,Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.,I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.,Thanks to you.
Are you kidding?,I always said you were a gentleman.
This ought to be good.,Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...,Yeah, you're a real hero.
What about Leia and the Wookiee?,You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.,I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
It's a lovely outpost.,Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
What about Han?,I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
We've got to find Luke.,His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
What?,Luke needs help.  We must go back.
Someone's falling.,It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.,That sounds familiar.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.,I understand.
You rest now.,So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
You don't have to do this to impress me.,If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...,Let's go.
Leia!,Luke, no!  It's a trap.
This hyperdrive had better work.,I've never seen it fail.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.,I thought I was in good shape.
I can't. It's too big.,Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.,I thought those seekers were set for stun!
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?,No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
Will they die?,Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.,Time will tell.
Yes, My Lord.,Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
Go easy, Stevie.,They look pretty docile.
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.,C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
I tried...,Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.,We'll see.
Where is he?,He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
Give it to me.,You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
Oh Cuervo...,What?
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?,I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.,Not anymore.
I'm already dead.,I see your point. What's the favor?
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.,Dream on, blue eye.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?,We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
See you in hell, Snake.,If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.,Can you land?
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?,You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.,You don't understand. It's already in you.
Defense against what?,There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.,Delgado?
Cease fire with the bullshit.,Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.,Where?
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.,Are you crazy?
What are they?,They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
Who?,The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?,I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
Where's the anti-toxin...?,Give me the prototype.
All of us?,Yeah.
When you threw it in, what did you see?,...I saw nothing.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.,Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
Perceval, you have returned!,Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.,I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
Whose son am I?,You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur.
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--,'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.,I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--,Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.,What's this, what's this?!
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...,What is it my child?
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...,My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?,I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.,So be it.
Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.,You freed it, son?
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...,--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
Why can't you be my champion?,If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
And you cannot love me...,The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.,Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?,Because you and the land are one.
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?,There is one.
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...,--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
It is.,Can it truly be used for magic?
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.,That I cannot.
You are truly magnificent!,Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
You provoke me, Merlin.,What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.,--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.,Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.,Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
The oath. You didn't say--,You didn't ask!
Well why are they tearing the building down?,Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.,What's he doing there? Teaching?
No, he's working on another book.,Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.,Thank you your excellency.
I'm sorry.,You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.,You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
Didn't who tell me?,Burke.
What did the doctor say?,We have to start looking for a shrink.
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?,No, she was heavily sedated.
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?,Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?,Of course. Have you got a pen?
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!,No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?,No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.,What is it? A tranquilizer?
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?,The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.,No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
Chris MacNeil?,Please go away.
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?,It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?,That depends.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?,I beg your pardon?
Oh yeah, since when?,Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
To begin with it could make things worse.,But how?
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?,No.
No it's alright I'll take it straight.,Are you sure?
Have you told him what's happening?,No
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?,Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
We'll see when we get home okay.,When can I have one?
Hey, where'd this come from?,I found it.
Where?,The closet
Who's Captain Howdy?,You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
Oh, Captain Howdy....,He's nice.
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.,Well, maybe he's sleeping.
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?,You like him.
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?,Your not gonna marry him are you?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.,What?
What are you doing here?,My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?,St. Mike's.
Karras.,That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
Where'd you get it then?,I stole it.
Think you can sleep?,Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.,And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?,That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
No now.,In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
Quod nomen mihi est?,Bon Jour.
Quod nomen mihi est?,La plume de ma tante.
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?,Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
I'm all right.,How's your leg?
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?,Why?
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen.,I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
And also with you.,Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.,Amen
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.,Amen
The Lord be with you.,And also with you.
Shut up!!,... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
Why this girl it makes no sense?,I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.,What's this about?
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.,I once did a paper on it
It's possible. Possible however,Unlikely.
Hey, Father? You like movies?,Very much.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.,Who's in it?
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?,Come on!
Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...,Bastards! Stop!
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!,Shove it up your ass you faggot!
...Be gone!!,Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
Are you comfortable Regan?,Yes.
I'm afraid.,If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
Give me the keys!,You're not going to drive!
Frankie.,You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.,Take it now.
So?,So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.,It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
Trunks?,Swimming trunks.
Well, look at this.,You bring trunks, Jack?
They gotta go.,How many?
Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.,Accident?
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.,Get your hand off me.
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!,How's the birthday girl?
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.,Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...,Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.
What's the gig?,Two nights.
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?,Am I late?
That's not the point.,What's the point?
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?,Lotta water.
You're their uncle.,Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
What d'ya got?,Yamaha white.  Nice.
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.,What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
No, I mean it.,So do I.
This time you gotta go.,I don't gotta go.
You gotta go.,Says who?
So what'd we get her?,You'll see.
Nice, huh?,What?
No?,No.
Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.,What?
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.,You're a fucking alarm clock.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.,She's here.
Oh, brother.,And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.',I'll take my chances.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.,You wanna get a drink?
Day.  Wednesday.,Last?
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.,A few bars!
But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.,Right.
We're gonna be here a week?,Yeah.
What?,I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
How dare you say you love me.,It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
Really.,Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.,She's a big girl.
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?,We were just having a little discussion about morality.
He's with the hotel.  I called him.,What are you talking about?
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.,He was wearing a suit.
The Royal.,Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
They were simple songs.,Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?,Yeah.
What do you mean?,I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
Nothing. We get nothing.,I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
What disease?,I don't know.
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.,I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.,Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
Looks like these got a few years on them.,This'll kill 'em.
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?,Five years ago.  November.
Sick?  How sick?,The flu.
Actually, that's my stage name.,I'm sorry?
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.,Well, that's fine --
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.,Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
Ready?,What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
What I mean is --,We're a team.  We work together.
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.,Where's my name?
What-?,And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.,Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
A seven.,My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
I wear a seven.,Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Shoes?,Right.
Maybe it's legit.,Maybe.  I'll call him.
You two could play checkers.,Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
You play all these places?,Baker's unabridged.
Virgins?,First times. Hey, look at this.
Hey, we're connected.,Great.
What's with you two?,Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?,Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?,I'll call you.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?,We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
Whatcha doin' over there?,Gotta go.
Funny hours.,Funny job.
And you don't?,He leads, I follow.
Is that the way it is?,Pretty much.
He takes after our mother.,Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.,You want me to walk you?
Aren't the kids asleep?,Every year.
So why's he do it?,I guess in case one year they're not.
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.,Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.,Just dinner and dance, right?
What's the matter?,Nothing.
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.,How come you didn't close your eyes?
My father proposed to my mother in there.,No kidding?
He had a mind that escalated things.,So, what happened?
Yeah... No.,Look, if you want to leave...
Yeah.,So how's the cat food business?
Yeah.,Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?,Losing his teeth.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.,Another five years, huh?
How do you know?,I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Ivory.,Looks old.
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?,Sure.
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?,Eddie.
You mean if I get sick?,They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
Fine work, Jon.,Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.,How old is he?
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.,Let me have a look.
For being one helluva guy.,"Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
... I was dreaming ...,Something good?
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.,So you had a nightmare.
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.,And you wouldn't be.
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...,One last time.  It's important ...
Whoever you are, don't call again.,Don't hang up ...
How did he expect to do that?,An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.,Jon, what is it?
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.,Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?,Would it?
Go on.,Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.,I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
-- Castor?,Not anymore.
Stay away from my family!,Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
They're too tight.,So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.,Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...,Well, I saw you -- Kim.
You always call me Miss Brewster.,Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.,You can't blame me for trying.
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.,You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
I'm just having some fun.,There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
You'd have to start immediately.,Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?,What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
What is with you tonight?,Don't I usually kiss my wife?
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?,I'm not going anywhere.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.,The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.,Great.
Nothing.,I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
Where's Jamie?,That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
I'm going to the powder room.,Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
Oh, and Oxxford called...,Ooh, my suits are ready...
Her assistant?,Yeah Jack, her assistant...
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...,Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
Hello?,Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
Take you, for instance...,What about me?
Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.,I dont think youre hearing me.
Fightings a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?,Im not worried, Mom. Hes still learning our ways...
This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...,Wheres my real dad?
Try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up.,Got it.  Good tip.
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.,Like what?
Very nice. What is it?,Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Is it morning yet?,No, honey. Go back to sleep.
Were friends, arent we?,Maybe I dont say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
Trouble at work?,I dont think so.
You see, its like were in each others heads...,Kates my wife...
Howd you know my name?,We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.,I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
Yeah?  What do you need?,Me?
You just said everyone needs something.,I've got everything I need.
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.,Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this.  You brought this on yourself...
Miss me, Jack?,Thats my car!  You stole my car!
Its a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...,What?!
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of em take a couple seconds...  ...some of em take a lot longer...,I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!
Thats it?  Thats all I get?!  A glare?!,Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
What're you talkin' about?,You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
What!?  Look at the ticket...!,Get out, I call 911.
Like the dress...?,Its lovely...
Finger food...?,I dont think so, thank you...
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.,Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...,Frank.  Wheres Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?,No, I didnt...thats great.
Why dont you let me take this one, Kenny?,Okay, chief.
I have a bad feeling about this.,About the plane? What do you think its gonna crash? Dont say that...
Dont  go, Jack...,You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
The city?  New York City?  Why?,Because thats where I live.
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?,Funny, Jack.  Im laughing on the inside.
Yes, Im fine.  Its just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!,Uh huh...
Shes your dog, Jack.,No, shes not.
Thanks, Jack...,No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
I mean...wow...off the charts great.,Its an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  Im gonna buy it...
No?,Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Excuse me?,I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
Well...Annie for one.,Surprise.  Were pregnant...  Yeah...that mustve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
The trek out to the hospital every day didnt help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...,You had a heart attack?
Not it...?,Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet.
I found it at an outlet store.  I know its a knock-off, but I think itll look great on you...,Zeena...
Heres the thing.  I really hadnt planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversarys good all day...,What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until its light out.
I need to tell you something.,Okay...
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.,And now...?
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youve seen my pay check.,Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
Good things...,What are you sure about?
Annie goes to a great school.,Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?,This is New York City, its like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...,Then get a goddamn snow blower!
Its been interesting, thats for sure.,But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
Kate...,Jack...God, its been so long...You look...
You look great.,Its good to see you...
So youre not at a non- profit firm?,Not with what they pay me...
You cant go!,Jesus, Jack...
Dont get on that plane!,Jack.
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...,That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
For the money, theyre hands down the best radial we carry...,Okay, Ill take them...
Last night was great...,You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?,Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning...  Okay?,If it's something you feel strongly about.
I found it!,Congratulations. The La Guardia flights canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
I don't think She's real big on hate.,You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.,Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I'm not really dressed for a party.,Relax, it's casual.
Those yours too?,My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --,Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
I had it at four.,This makes five.
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.,Victor's better at these things.
The shields on the station should protect us.,<u>Should</u>?
He's smart, powerful, successful --,Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
What the --!,Ben.  Are you okay?
You got a chisel round here?,If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Ben --,Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.,Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.,'Course not.  Strictly business.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.,Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Reed? ... Sue?,They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.,I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?,I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --,It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --,It's easy for you to be patient.
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!,Ben, are you there?
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--,What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Back it down, Johnny!,I can go hotter!
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.,Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --,Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
You're hot!,So are you!
I though we went over this.,Last one down springs for room service.
Sweet.,That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!,You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?,At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
They're ready for you, sir.,Showtime.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?,Not at all.
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --,The number's <u>seventy-five</u>.  And it's applications <u>and</u> patents.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?,Hilarious.
Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.,Sure.
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.,Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
Come on, Ben, come on...,Reed, we're running out of time.
Not until Ben is back inside!,It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --,Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --,Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.,Great minds think alike.
Feeling better?,Yes, thanks.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?,That's what we're here to find out.
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --,He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --,Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
What's going on?,Victor, are you feeling alright?
Victor, your scar --,I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --,Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --,Susan.  What are you doing?
I know that. But what's the maximum?,In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.,It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!
What're you getting at?,If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
How bad off is he?,Brain injury.
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?,Before he could breathe a word. He's the only scientist who knows the answer to what we're after. That's why we have to operate --
-- and why we need you.,<Me>?
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?,Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --,What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
Wish I knew why.,Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?,We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
Right, sir.,Come along, they'll be operating shortly.  See you later, Mike.
General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.,We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
Trip? Where to?,Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
Yes, we'd like to get moving.,Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.,And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.,But big enough for us...
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...,You may learn to like it.
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.,Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.,You can't --it's too dangerous --
You must carry spare parts --,Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
A surgeon might...,Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
Doctor, what's wrong?,I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.,You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --,You left something out.
What's that?,The Breath of God...
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.,Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.,Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
Tell them to take us out.,If there's any chance --
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --,Well, we better get on with it.
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.,Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?,Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?,Send the following message...
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.,I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
What'd you do that for?,I'm married.
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?,They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...,Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
What is it, Skipper?,We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.,Was there any damage?
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.,We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.,I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!,May I have your ticket, please?
This is a new car, then, sir?,It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.,Certainly -
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?,...What're you talking about?
Or your fucking wife, you know.,Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
We stop at Pancakes Hause.,What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
...Come on, man. Okay, here's an idea. We'll stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya think?,I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
...Look at that. Twin Cities.  IDS Building, the big glass one.  Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.  After the Sears, uh, Chicago...  You never been to Minneapolis?,No.
Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know.,Geez. That's more'n I've heard you say all week.
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.,Whoa, Daddy.
Clear him off the road.,Yeah.
She started shrieking, you know.,Jezhush.
Huh?,The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!,Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...
Oh, don't be silly.,Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.,Uh-huh - in what way?
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.,Uh-huh... A what?
I dunno. Just funny-looking.,Can you be any more specific?
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.,Uh-huh.
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?,No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.,Yah, I see.
...If it's so damned important to ya!,I'm sorry, sir, I -
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -,Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
Yah, well, they exist all right.,I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -,No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
Jerry Lundegaard.,All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?,Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
Yah!,Jerome Lundegaard?
...Dad?,It's okay, Scotty.

Whose car?,My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.,Yah, ya think?
Not on your feet too much?,No, no.
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?,Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Was it reasonable?,Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
...So?,Three-cent stamp.
It's just the three cent.,It's terrific!
Yah.,When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
This is do-able.,Congratulations, Jerry.
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?,Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
There's no one else here.,I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
No.  I found something new.,Really, what's that?
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.,Here are your flight coupons.  Call me from the road if there are any snags.  Your itinerary...
After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything.,Have you finished those reports?
And I saw you practicing this...,Practicing what?
I want that.,You can't have the whole brain!
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?,Should we?
It's for men.,Like testicular cancer?
Look, this is a bad time...,I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.,No... no problem.
The Paper Street Soap Company.,Can I come in?
What kind of stupid question is that?!,Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
What did you say... ?,What is wrong with you?
Say my name!  What's my name!?,Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.,Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.,Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...,You are an insane person.
Tyler...,I'm begging you.  Get on the bus. Get on the bus.
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.,I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...,Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...,I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.,Okay, everyone.
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.,Now, find your power animal.
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.,Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
This is how I met --,Tyler Durden.
What?,Being clever.
Insurance'll cover it.,Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
Yeah.,So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
No, I...,Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
They're called "cigarette burns.",It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
A nice, big cock.,Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.,He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?,I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.,Where do you want it?  In the face?
"I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in first person.  "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."  There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate.","I get cancer, and I kill Joe."
A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.,If you could fight any celebrity?
You?,Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
You're sure?,Yeah, I'm sure.
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.,Okay.
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.,I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...,It isn't... ?
No thanks, I quit.,You quit?
There's fight club in Delaware City.,I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
I feel sick.,Imagine how he feels.
Why do you think I blew up your condo?,What?
Why did you do that?,Answer me, Tyler.
Is this really news to you?,What are you talking about... ?
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!,This isn't possible...
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?,What about them?  They're lunatics.
Fuck you.,I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.,Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
Ask me nicely.,Defuse the bomb, please.
Can't you call it off... ?,It's out of our hands.  This is it.
Please...,Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
What the fuck -- ?,Paraffin.
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...,Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...,... no, no, no...
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?,It's the only way to get rid of you...
Appreciate something.,What?
His name is Robert Paulson!,No!
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?,We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
What are you doing?!,Pleeeeeease!
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!,We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
S-S-Stuff.,"Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.,Too much school.
Would you rather be dead?,No, please, no, God, no!
The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.,I hope you're ready for this.
You have to tell us now.,I...I...
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?,What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
What did you see?  What am I looking for?,No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
Another premonition?,Yes.  I was in a hospital.  There was screaming... A nurse was choking me.  I couldn't tell what she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face.  Kalarjian.
What do you want me to do?,Speed up.
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.,Don't sweat it.  It's over.
I'm not sure I understand.,Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.,That lucky bastard.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?,Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.,Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
What?,I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
May we come in?,No.  What's this about?
Do you remember what triggered it all?,The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
I tried calling last night but your father --,Evan Shaeffer's dead.
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.,We have to tell her she's in danger!
I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up.,Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.,Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...,I know, Dad.
I mean it.  Take care of it.,I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
"It?",What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
Is that something you're "feeling?",I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
That... him?,I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!,Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!,Get out! Get out of the car!
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!,I wish you were on the plane!
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.,You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?,No!
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.,That's a plan.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...,Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?,No.
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.,Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.,Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...,There's the Mekong.
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.,Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
Ever do this from a jet?,No.
Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!,Start over.
That's what I'm here for.,Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
You okay?,Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.,Where's your stuff?
This place is a trip.,Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
What's this stuff on the rice?,Fermented fish sauce.
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?,Yeah...
What's she saying?,She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
I'm getting him out.,What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
Are they going to torture us?,Yes.
Can you handle the door gun?,Duck soup.
How did you get started working for the spooks?,Spooks?
Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.,Where's his father?
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.,Nguyen is good boy.
Thanks.,Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Yes you can.,How?
That's an order.,Sorry, Sir.
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.,What's the plan?
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.,We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
All this is for us?,That's right.
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.,It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
Congressional Medal of Honor.,Yeah.  Big time.
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.,But now it's free, right?
Yes!  They'll be in soon.,Well, I guess I'll come back then.
...SO...anybody special in your life?,Do I look like I have someone special?
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.,Got any more bread crust?
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...,What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?,Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
You're kidding!  What did he say?,He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!,<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
But..How could that happen?,Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives?  Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. 
What if I was a relative?,You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?,I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
You a friend of Parry's?,No...  He is supposed to live there?
No...no...we can't...we can't..,Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?,Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?,Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...,Yes... I... I agree...
They're putting me on film tomorrow.,Fine.
How un-sixties of you.,I was nine in the sixties.
Hello Lydia?,Yeah?  Who is this?
Your name was picked.,Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Well there....  What's the difference?,Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Now what?,Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Free?,Yes.  They're free.
<u>What</u>?!,Sshhhh!
... Do you know who I am?,Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...,Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...,Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Parry.,Parry... I'm Jack.
Thanks... You can keep the doll.,Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.
I'm not married.,Funny -- you look married.
Do you follow her every day?,Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
Why did you do that?,Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!,No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.,You really want to help me?
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.,You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...,That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!,You're totally gone, aren't you?
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.,Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!,Bingo!
Happily married, probably.,Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Holdin' my penis...,<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.,I know!
OWWW....What are you nuts?!,BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
Parry Parry?,No just Parry.
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.,I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...,Got any Ethel Merman?
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.,What a gyp.
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.,It sounds exciting.
What do you do - for a living I mean?,Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
I don't drink coffee...,... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.,Listen, you're very nice... b...
... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.,Shhh...
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.,Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.,Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
You're not going to play it again.,Well, lemme play the other side then.
Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself...  You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?,You're playing the other side.
Now, now.,No, dammit, I would easy.
You know what, you are never satisfied.,That's right, hand.
I did, didn' I, El?,You got another ball comin'.
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.,I'm not.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.,Do you love me, Bobby?
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?,Is what you?
You're depressed that I come along.,Who said I was depressed?
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?,I don't know.
Sure you don't want anything?,Fill it up.
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!,You're lucky no one was hurt.
How far are you going to?,Washington.
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.,I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?,Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
You want me to hold the chicken.,Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
Robert...,Very nice.
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.,Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
Robert, I have to tell you something...,What?
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...,Yeah, me, too...
What questions?,Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?,I don't know.
I think he's got a terrific personality.,You know, he was formerly a sailor.
I'm talking to you, Tita!,Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
You were going without saying goodbye?,I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
But what about me?,I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
What have you been doing since then?,What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
Yes, intentionally.,That's dangerous, you know.
Nothing.,Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...,I gave it a second thought.
Is that funny?,It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.,I didn't have any.
You think I'm a fake.,I think it's what you think.
As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl...  How are you?,I'm fine.
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...,No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.,Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
Oh no, it's been much more than that.,Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
But I'd like to say, so that I don't dampen the spirit of your adventure...,You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!,Jesus, what a rude person...
Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.,That's an old maid's tale.
Don't call me "mack," honey.,I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...,Steam.
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...,There's some good things on it, though.
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...,Well, she was.
Miss Dupea.,Yes.
Don't fuck wit' me! Don't fuck wit' me.  My lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in Alaska, so dress warn.,Aaron, how you doin'?
I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated.,Then don't go out with me.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.,Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
Do you have a name?,Victor.
What?,Victor.
What are you doin' here?,I, umm, came to see you.
That's it?,Nah, we make out and stuff.
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?,I kissed those girls.
Why don't you ask Eddie?,Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
Fa what?,I won't let my motha cut my hair.
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.,I can't man, I'm punished!
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?,C'mon.
I think by Twenty-two.,For real?
Yo! What you goin' for,'Cause you know what, you're not supposed to know but yesterday she lent me her pills for her Moms and if I don't give 'em to her she's gonna die. You want her to die?
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.,How old is he?
What she look like?,She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
My friend told me she lived around here.,Your friend must be misinformed.
So what do you want with her anyway?,I'm a good friend of hers.
How do I know you're not lying.,Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
You live around here?,Yeah.
I know how ta get him back if you want.,Nah.
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.,You're kidding.
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.,You mean her.
That's what he said.,He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
Wonder who his supplier is.,I have no idea.
Creasy, how old are you?,Nineteen.
Hey you're really nuts.,They didn't do anything.
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.,You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
You can't keep me here.,Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
Ask anybody.,Can I ask anybody now?
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.,Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
So where do you know Alan from?,We play tennis at the club.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.,Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Right.,Well, which one?
Is she ever. I've got some stories....,I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.,Oh, he was dying for years.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.,He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.,Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?,I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?,Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
No idea at all?,Okay. Some idea.
What, the heat here?,Affirmative.
Thought so. What for?,For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?,Nothing. They're still there.
Here you are, Doctor.,Thank you.
That's it.,This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.,What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
Until she remarries, Fletch.,Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
You should have proved that in a court of law.,My lawyer was a bum.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.,This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.,The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.,Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Right.,Well, I'm fully covered.
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....,Velma.
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.,Where are you going?
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.,I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.,Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Alan Stanwyk.,Charmed.
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.,I'm all ears.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?,I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
Do you have a passport?,Sure, all drifters do.
That's right.,You sure got the hard part.
Will you kill me?,Sure.
'Magic' today, huh?,Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Shoot.,Don't say shoot, okay.
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.,No problem, boss.
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.',I wonder if that's his doctor.
She's cute as a button.,How long have they been married?
John who?,John Ultrarelamensky.
That's a strange combination.,So were my parents.
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.,Please.
Damn, I thought I had that one.,You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
I bet you do.,Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.,You are a rich woman.
Hi.,Hi.
I really should change.,No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
You were in the war?,No. He was. I got him out.
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.',Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Can I ask you a question?,Depends on the question.
Are you still in love with Alan?,No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
Why'd you let me in?,Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.,I think you should call me Gail, now.
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?,Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
What are you talking about?,That's what I want to know.
What are you talking about?,I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???,I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.,Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?,Cabana one.
I commend him on his choice.,What?
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.,She moved out.
What did you want under the bed?,Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
I never read the paper.,...never reads the paper...
So let's go! We run the pictures.,He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?,Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
How could you call him?,It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.,Get out of here.
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.,What?  Who the hell are they?
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. ,What...
Not really.,Not really?
Yes?,Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.,John!
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?,Of course.
But I ain't got you...,But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...,No, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...,I said, I ain't got you...
Actually, you may take it all now.,Oh... I have some questions.
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...,Who?
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.,Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!,We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
That was close...,What did these Vancouver factories do?
Art Mo-o-o-ney!,Thanks, I needed that.
So many assholes, so few bullets.,Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.,Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
I do it for love.,'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...,Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?,No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?,Contacts.
You okay?,Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part...,I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s
Got those Vomit invites here...,Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
Let's get serious...,Why are all these people after me?
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...,Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.',People still watch that?
Pretty smooth, huh?,Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.,ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
I'm sorry...,Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
I tried to help you...!,And hey, I appreciate it...
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?,Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Yeah, go on...,Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
It's me.,What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Two words.  Disco Express.,Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
Like me.,I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.,<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.,<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
It doesn't have to be like this?,Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
Kill them.  Not quickly.,Are you okay?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.,Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
You'd said something about proof...,Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.,Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
I'm still the king!,Julian, you're fired.
You're that guy, the private eye.,You're a poet and didn't know it.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?,I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
How nice.,It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
What?,Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
Who knows?,Where do you want it?
What's your name, asshole?,Fuck you, Santa Claus!
I don't know what you're talkin' about.,Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Did they follow you?,I wasn't looking.
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.,You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.,Pour moi?
Are you sure it is dead?,I'm going to put them on the cat.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.,Mmm.
What's your story?,Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
I got no music!,Fake it.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.,He got off on six.
There's nobody like that on six.,Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
When ya go back on?,Morning.  Sometime.
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.,Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.,Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.,Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
Monica?  Who's Monica?,A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.,Suspicion of what?
What happened to you?,The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
Hey, Bo.,Hiya, Jesus.
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.,Why is it called Hellgate?
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.,I been damn careful up to now.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.,I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
What are you saying?,You know what I'm saying.
They around?,Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
Why haven't they killed the juice?,Switches are shorted out.
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.,We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
How do we get to the vault door?,There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?,I'm alright, Gibby.
It looks open on the other side.,Don't know what's behind it.
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.,Sure.
Frank...what's wrong?,Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.
Where's Johnny?,I tucked him in at Gordo's.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.,I know.  He loves that thing.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.,I'm serious.
Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.,The future guy?
Lucky throw, fire boy.,Luck, my ass.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.,Hello, Frank.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.,I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
About what?,Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.,Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
I swear, Satch.,Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
As nuts as that sounds, yes.,Uh, huh.
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.,Frank, this is insane...
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.,Next time lets put some money on it.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.,Daddy, I'm scared.
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.,I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
Uh, hello?,WB2YKXB, who've I got?
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?,Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.,I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.,I can't believe people are still using these things.
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?,Huh?
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...,What?
What's going on?,Nothing...I just spilled something.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.,Sun spot?
Yeah, that's how Hams work.,Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
It's really you, isn't it?,Yeah...I think so.
Why?,Fire.
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...,I don't understand.
Dad, you there?  You okay?,Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.,Tell me.
What are you talking about?,Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.,I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
I'll be damned.,Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.,It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Yeah, you betcha.,Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.,No.
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...,I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
What?,He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?,In my pocket.
Please, Dad, just do it.,Okay, okay...
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?,Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
Dad, what the hell is going on?,Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
My father didn't die in a fire?,Huh?
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?,Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
I better give you my address then.,Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
Maybe you outta lay off a little...,Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
Okay, lemme walk you through it.,Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
What?,I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.,You work too hard, John.
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.,Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
I look familiar?,No.  What house you work?
Nah, just working the job.,I hear that.
No kiddin'?,No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
Huh.,Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
Sullivan?,You have the right to speak to an att --
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!,"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
What're you gonna do?,Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
What was that?,Where's Shelly?
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.,Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
What're you doing?,We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!,Yes, man!
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!,Chuck... look.
I'm a slow eater.,I love you, man!
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?,I can't even remember what day it is, man.
What's the matter?!,Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Derek... stop.,Why?
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.,Is that so bad?
Look what I found.  Remember these?,Did you stay here last night?
This is too painful to look at.,Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
Is... is everything all right?,Everything's gonna be fine.
Please... be cool.,May be please have the wallet.
See anything?,Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
Got any good ideas?,Maybe.
You don't "have to.",I just want you to like me.
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.,Who's Horace?
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.,We're gonna scare him?!
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.,That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.,Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.,This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
No.  No, it's not...,Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?,It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
Lake Forest Green?,Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?,No more.
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.,Are they grown-ups?
I can't believe no one called back.  I better...,Who ya calling?
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.,All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
So where's Cort gone off to?,Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.,Yeah, we're here.
Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...,Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?,Yes, but they released me because...
I gotta show you Jason's grave.,I've seen it.
Eight times.,Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.,They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --,-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...,The what?
I gotta get back to work.,Okay, I'll call you later.
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.,Okay.
You're talking about my lady.,She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.,I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.,That's all right.  I was just...
She's beautiful.,Her name's Stephanie.
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...,Next, you dial a number.
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?,Oh my God, Steven.
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.,She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...,The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
Have you seen Tamara?,No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.,He bought you that?
A major prick.,What are you going to do?
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.,Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.,You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
Well...how do you feel?,Ask me in about five minutes.
Did you hear that?,Hear what?
But I thought...,She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
Jason's here in New York.,Don't be ridiculous!
Where did you get that alcohol?,I packed it. Just for us.
I thought I told you to stay away from her.,Where is she?
What are you doing??,That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
Did you find Rennie?,She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
What did you do with Rennie??,Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
I...I can't...,You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
I'm glad you decided to come after all.,Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
Everything okay?,Just felt a little chill.
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?,Really?
So, are you having fun yet?,Yeah...a lot.
I can't swim.,I gathered that.
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.,It's not that simple.
You have to call the police...,Please, hurry...
Crosstown.,Very bad today.
I never left the garage without my Windex.,I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.,That's where I peed.
That's awful.,I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
You say we go?,Do not inhale.
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.,I don't have the problems that artists have.
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.,That was a big mistake.
Great game.,Unbelievable.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.,Can he get through it?
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.,About what?
Because we're completely mismatched.,We don't even like each other, do we?
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?,Why do you need a radio?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee',And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.,You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.,Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
Opening night?,I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.,Take it yourself. Take a date.
What will we talk about?,Everything.
See, Daddy.,I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
See, Daddy.,And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
I'll have whatever she's having.,I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
People are dependable.,I don't know if I can say that.
All the failures, all the fatalism.,Washed away.
This could be it!,This could be it!
We must have been heroic.,Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.,Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.,Since when did that matter?
Where's your elastic brace?,I can't find it.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.,I lost it. I lose everything.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.,Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
What do you want me to do?,Show him who we are.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.,Everybody else does. Why not you?
A grandmother. God bless you.,He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
You're charming the boy.,Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.,That's my cousin, Angelo.
Because life is good.,Because faith is rewarded.
Yessiree, Bob.,Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?,Burnt sienna.
Say it again.,What?
You know what.,Alla puttanesca.
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?,I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.,And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
It is the work of untouchables.,In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --,Stop!
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?,Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
Enough.,One more.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.,Some of it good, I hope.
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...,Well, we shall try.
...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.,How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
What was he like?,Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
What can we do?,We must end the campaign.
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.,It was one incident.
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.,I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.,Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response.",You will respect the law.
You're an ambitious man.,I hope not.
Are you going to walk all the way?,My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about.,Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.,I --
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.,An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!,Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
We need your help!,There is nothing I can give.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.,Somehow I expected not.
You're an extraordinary man.,I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
And that's the basis of this "Declaration of Independence"?,Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "Free India." Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.
Could we cut all news off? I know --,Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
There are a few million miles to go yet.,It's over.
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.,I like football.
How much extra?,It would be five thousand more.
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.,Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--,--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.,A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
Surely you know what you have.,We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
Hello.,Jerome--?
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?,Six one.
You okay, Jerome?,Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
Who died?,The Mission Director.
That's not the point.,Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
Where?,In a corridor.
Is that all?,I've got enough on my mind without that.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.,If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
How was your evening?,Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?",I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
How are you, Jerome?,Not bad, Jerome.
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.,Antonio, the choir...
What will happen to the others?,They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--,How do I square the accident?
,That's the hair color in his profile?
Not that.,They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
No bother.,I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?,I was at home.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.,We were just looking.
Who are they?,It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
My medication.  I left it back there.,We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
A year is a long time.,Not so long--just once around the sun.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.,I'll tell you at the end of the week.
I've got enough here.,Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?,They will be ready. You guys do your job.
Hello, McCoy.,Beynon.
Three... Rudy got ambitious.,And you got him...
I'm in a hurry.,You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.,I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.,So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.,Get it over with...
Where did you get those?,I've been doing my homework.
How's Estelle?,Fatter... some things never change.
I guess I'm kind of...,It's all right.
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.,Suit yourself.
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.,I couldn't have... much longer.
Why are you laughing?,I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
Why?,There are three men dead.
Do you trust him?,I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.,If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
Yeah.,You sent me to him.
He must have.,It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
What do you want to do?,Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.,You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
That would be the first time.,When are you going to learn?
You can't trust anything these days.,I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
Things can't get much worse can they?,I don't see how.
I don't know.,Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
You're crazy.,Get your clothes on, move your butt.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.,Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
Where's home?,Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.,Oh my God.
Can I help you?,Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?,You serious?
Sure am.,And I keep my mouth shut?
What's the damage?,Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
A couple of weeks back.,How?
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.,Who?
What about the brakes?,Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.,Why?
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.,Why?
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.,Jack, you're wrong.
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.,Jack...
Who paid you to see me off?,I can't Jack. How can I?
I want to talk to you later.,I can't.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?,Yes.
Though nicer than most?,Yes. I can't help the way I am.
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?,It's the truth.
You know Sid Fletcher?,I work for him.
Do you?,Yes, I do.
Sid Fletcher.,Oh, do you?
Could you do me a favour?,Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
How'd you know where I'd be?,You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?,He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
The young girl. Who pulled her?,I don't know.
Thanks for coming.,Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?,They said he was drunk.
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.,What?
I mean, what for?,That's what I was wondering.
It just would. He was always the same.,Since when did he drink whisky?
Don't know.,Nobody seems to know.
You work here, Keith?,Yes.
Where would I find him?,Today? At the races. He always goes.
How'd you know Albert?,Went to school with him.  He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
Nowt.,Good lad.
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.,How many?
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.,Who's Brumby?
Did they give you a rough time?,No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
I won't be using the room tonight.,I see.
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?,Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
They bloody hurt me.,You're lucky. They kill as well.

You wouldn't.,How'd you know I wouldn't?
Did you sleep well?,Yes, thank you.
You coming back?,How could I stay away?
Didn't you know this is my home town?,No, I didn't know that.

Eh? Have a drink.,Still got your sense of humour.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.,Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.,Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
Gerald wants to see him first.,Shut up.
Not suede boots!,Knock it off, Gerald.
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?,Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
All right. Two hundred.,Ha.

And it's not right to the customers.,I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...,He is?

Yes.  I hear you.,You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
You are?,Yes, I am.
Why I don't...,You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
How do you know I made it up?,What are you talking about?
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?,You're so full of shit.

Fuck her...,"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
You closed 'em today?,Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means?

Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?,I think I'd better stay here for a while.
Yes.,I don't know.
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?,What do I...?

Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.,She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...,You going to turn State's?
Guess what the Machine did?,Fuck the Machine.
You hear what I said?,Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...,Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...,Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
What is this, your farewell speech?,I'm going home.
Yes.,Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
Three?  I count two.,Three.
Do you like them?,I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
I know.  How long will you be gone?,Just a few days.
Your friend lives in a fine building.,Oh yes, the very best.
Who is the greatest man you can think of?,Go on, answer him when he talks to you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi... Garibaldi.
What took so long?,She couldn't decide.
Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.,That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
I want to talk to you, Michael.,The children can stay.
Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.,I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
Goddamn bitch.,Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.,I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
I don't want to stay here...,Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?,It's not talk; I'm doing it.
You would risk your life for strangers?,Not for strangers; for my country.
He is weak.,He will grow strong.
Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.,You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?,Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
Count on me; that's my specialty.,I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...,What's that?
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?,Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.,...Who?
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.,We have time.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.,I've always taken care of you.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!,It's the way Pop wanted it.
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.,In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
Within the compound will be fine.,I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
That's off now.,I'm going to see my parents.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...,Am I a prisoner?
Will you tell him?,I don't know.
She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.,I can't let him down.
If you need anything, just...,Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.,Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?,I took care of it.
Go on, tell me.,Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
Was it a boy or a girl?,Mike, at three and a half...
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?,Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.,His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?,Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
It might show.,Mike wants it.
What's up?,No questions.
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.,He's going to try Panama...
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.,Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.,Do you gamble?
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.,Very well.
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.,The witness is excused; take him out.
This committee owes an apology!,The committee is adjourned until further notice.
Kay.,Yes, Michael.
Where?,In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.,I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
Are you Klingman?,Who's asking?
What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.,The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case.
Nothing is more important.,Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.,Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.,I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?,No, I'm fine.
It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.,So?
I just left our friend in Miami.,How is his health?
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?,I deny his every charge.
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?,That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.,I do not.
I want you to help me take my revenge.,Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
I want you to settle on their terms.,Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.,And?
Don't I look like I'm listening?,We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?,We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.,We got friends in the commission.
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.,Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.,Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.,You liked it too.
Sure.  I loved it.,If you enjoy it, you should do it.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?,Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.,I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?,You will not hurt him?
Something I can do for you?,The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?,He is dead now, twenty years.
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.,I'm not going to hurt anyone.
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.,But I didn't do this!
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.,But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?,Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
Or would you prefer a beer?,No.  Iced tea's fine.
These are your paintings?,What?  Oh yes.
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?,This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.,Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.,What did she mean by going flooey?
You went to university?,Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.,You don't say?  Which picture?
Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.,No.  I'm fine.
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.,What?
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.,I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
Do you mind?,Go ahead.
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.,Did you now?
What way might that be?,You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.,I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --,Cut it out!
Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?,I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.,I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?,Not fear.  More like disgust.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?,You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
Just go.  Please.  Why don't you go?,I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
I never made it to Korea.,But you said --
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.,That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here.",I don't remember that one.
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?,You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
You are much too human.,What did you expect?  Bronze?
Did I hurt you?,Nothing I didn't deserve.
I can undress myself, thank you.,All right.
I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.,You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
Hey, Boone.,Have a drink?
Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.,I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
You remember how a production eats up one's life.,Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
By the way, I like the Renoir.,Thank you.
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?,You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.,Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.,Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
Jimmy.  How are you?,Elsa?
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.,Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.,But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.,Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.,I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?,Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.,But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.,A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.,I guess.
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.,Righto.  Let me see.
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.,He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?,I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
It's been a long time, Memphis --,Six years ...
What's with the fish thing -- ?,We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce,No, but you dress like an asshole ...
Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?,How ya doing?
I'm just here about my brother.,I knew you'd say that, too --
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...,"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
Get out of here, Ray --,One more night --
Get out --,I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...,But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...,How is he?
I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...,A little family emergency --
Not my girl anymore,Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
What do you want from me?,Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
I know you.,You know my back.
I'll catch you later, Randall --,Double-meaning intended --
okay ...,It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
Forget that ...,Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?,I know. Weird, huh -- ?
How's it going -- ?,It's arright ...
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...,There's no one left ...
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.,one minute -- !
How are we supposed to--,Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
Why didn't you tell me?,I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...,Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...,What time of year?
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...,You've been pre-booked...
Whatcha got left ... ?,"Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
We'll take it...,It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
Sure -,How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
It looks just like a regular Mustang --,Don't go there, Toby --
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -,You, too
Cool. So you're living up North?,Yeah -
"About what?",About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--,Hey, now -
What are you doing here?,Otto called -
After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...,Thank-you ...
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?,The family that steals together, deals together...
Too early to tell. Nervous?,Nah.
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...,I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?,Sure, man --
Now what -- ?,Now, we go -
Shit ...,Run it...
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?,Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
And you got some Italians -- ?,Six or seven...
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...,Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ...
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.,No way ...
Slip it in ...,You're going high-cheese, dude --
Now... I'm in ...,Of course you are. You're a professional...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...,I bet you say that to all the girls...
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...,And Tracy's on the move ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...,How is he -- ?
Where to -- ?,Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
This time it's for real?,Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
Whatever do you mean?,The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
The hard part ...,"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
Is he still working here ?,The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...,And the moral of that story is -- ?
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?,You sure I can't go with ya?
What do you want, shithead?,Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
But he was always a bad kid, that one.,No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
Tell him. It's okay.,What?
I don't want any more of that Shit.,Wha?  Me?
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.,You treated me like shit.
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.,Liar!
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.,She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
You son of a bitch. She's been here.,What are you talking about?
Stop! Stop!,Let her carry this shit inside.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.,What did he say, exactly?
Then you're safer in here.,Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Who's gonna do that?,Just get me out.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.,Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
What happened? You okay?,I got seared.
What about the schools?,Yeah. What about the kids' school?
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.,Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.,What?
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.,What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
Watch this.,Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.,He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.,How?
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.,Yeah.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.,Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.,There's a shovel at my mother's.
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.,Will you get the fuck out of here.
Stay there.,Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
I hate to do dishes.,Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
Are you okay? What happened?,Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
What kind of person doesn't call?,He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.,Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
You want a partner?,Please?
Who's she talking to?,That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.,Fuck you, you fat fuck.
I've been shit faced for like two weeks.,Oh great, tell her that! Now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--,--or a tail--
Stop brushin' me back!,Stop crowdin the plate!
Who'd you call?,No one. I didn't have the number.
I didn't get on Cathy last night.,Why not?
What?,She went to Medical school in California.
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?,Week after I'm twenty-one.
It's a way outta here.,What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.,Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.,Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.,You don't know that.
You're kiddin' me.,Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
Hi.,How you doin'?
Oh, right.,This is your house, right?
Okay.,Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?,Well, I don't have no trousers on...
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.,I'm Irish.
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.,Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.,Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
What is it?,It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
You're in a safe place, Will.,It's touching me.
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--,Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
No, there's a limit.,The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
--Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is three to the K times--,--But--
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?,Yeah, can I help you?
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--,Which one's your building?
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.,Really?
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?,Of course.
Okay. How?,It's an integer proof.
That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?,I think so.
--That edge!,An integer.
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--,That's fine, but did you ever think--
Then don't set up any more meetings.,I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.,The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.,I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
This job... Do it if it's what you really want.,I appreciate that.
How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?,No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
So who won the bet?,I did.
Hello.,The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--,They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.,I'll be okay.
He married his cousin.,Who?
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--,Hold on!
Oh, that's nice--,--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.,That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--,--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
He won't be a failure!,If you push him into something, if you ride him--
Hello, Sean.,Come in.
Sean...,Me too.
Do you know when you'll be back?,I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
About thirty million to one.,You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
I could go for a Whopper.,Let's hit "Kelly's."
Well, she out did herself today...,I don't got a crush on her.
Yeah, I read those.,What did you think?
That must have taken you a long time.,Yeah, it did take me a long time.
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.,You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
What is?,I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
Yeah? You got a lady now?,Yeah, I went on a date last week.
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.,No, I don't.
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?,That's right.
I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl.","I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
They could see that I meant it.,You're kiddin' me.
Do you think you're alone?,What?
But you can't give back to them, Will.,Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?,I didn't ask for this.
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.,Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
Don't fuck with me.,It's not your fault.
Which one did you take, Will?,Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
I'll keep in touch.,I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
See ya.,Good luck.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.,I'm Will.
Five minutes.,What?
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.,Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.,Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
Sounds good, where are you now?,You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?,No.
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.,Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
Why do we always stay here?,'Cause it's nicer than my place.
I've never seen your place.,Exactly.
How's it goin'?,Fine.
Want me to take a look?,No.
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.,So, do you play the piano?
Yeah, I'm sure.,'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.,I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?,What am I scared of?
I just wanted to call before you left.  I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker.,I never cared about that.
You doin' the hirin'?,Well, I'm contracting the land.
Ready, Pa?,Let 'er go, Gallagher!
I'd come back--,But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.
You bust outa jail, Tom?,Naw. They paroled me.
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?,She got to make it.
Short fella. Pale face.,Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Want to work?,Sure, but what is this?
*You* find out, I can't.,Anything like work aroun' here?
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.,Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.,Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
Ain't you seen your folks since then?,No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.,I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?,I never heard nothin' about it.
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?,I ain't no preacher anymore.
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?,Thought you was in jail.
Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?,I dunno. Payin' five now.
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.,But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--,Lissen, I heard that before--
What's the matter? What's happened?,Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
Goin' far?,Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
Yeah.,That's where I get off.
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.,You been acrost?
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.,It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?,This here's a strike.
How long you plan to be in Arizona?,No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Got any plants?,No plants.
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.,You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?,No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us.,Maybe that's jus' what he done.
We gonna live here?,Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.,I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.,Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.,An' you won't let nobody touch me?
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!,Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
Pa! Shh!,How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
Mad, Ma?,Sometimes they do.
How about it, Ma?,I'm ready.
Yes'm, that was it.,Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
Look, Ma!,Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.,You promised, Tommy.
What is it?,Don't know--but it's better'n this.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.,Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.,It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.,He was a good man.
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.,How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...,Then what, Tom?
You can have this for ten cents.,I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.,But who done it?
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.,But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
Then who *do* we shoot?,Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back.,Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?,We gonna take whatever they got.
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.,Won't they ketch us?
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!,Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
Jes' like in the catalogues, ain't they!,I seen 'em b'fore you did.
You people looking for work?,Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
You sure you got ever'thing ready?,Ain't gonna be no trouble.
You're so funny...,I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.,I'm Martin Blank.
Bob. Bob Destephano.,What?
What am I gonna do?,What do you want to do?
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.,Insane.
Jesus...,Overflowing with love.
So you eat-- read it everyday?,Yes.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?,Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.,Here is now there. There is here.
What's your business?,I'm a professional killer.
Are you going to the reunion?,No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
That's part of it.,Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?,Wow. I have to give this some thought.
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.,Like heroin?
Not the other way around...?,No.
Say more.,They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
Okay. Repeat this after me.,Out Loud?
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?,You understand the psychology of the job.
You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?,No.
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.,Up on the right.
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.,I guess.
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.,Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.,Yup.
They're not happy, sir.,I'm not happy.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.,He didn't.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.,Tell them my house exploded.
I bought a new rug.,That's wonderful, Mom.
You have a headache?,I have a headache. You have a headache?
Debi's house.,Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.,See you in ten years.
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.,To shoot you. Correct.
This is Annie MacLean.,Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.,Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.,Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
So how was your first and last day of branding?,Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
What?,You ever just stand still for a minute?
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.,Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.,Does Chicago count?
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?,Well, I, uh... you didn't...
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...,You sleeping all right in that house?
Enjoy the day.,You too.
Thanks.,Feel good?
Just make yourself comfortable.,I am comfortable.
You missed a button.,Huh?
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.,I don't care! We'd be together.
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?,The point was to love each other.
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --,I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?,Okay.
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --,-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?,What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
Did he tell you that?,He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
You buckled up?  You cold?,Little.
Gee, this looks like a fun place.,Don't they believe in signs here?
Let's bring your bags inside.,Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.,Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.,Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
Okay. We'll see you later then.,Yeah. Bye.
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?,Oh. Right. I'll call him.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.,Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
You've already made arrangements!?,No. I was just researching. Calm down.
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.,I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.,You're allergic to hay.
Yeah, what?,Take your time.
Yes?,Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...,Oh, I don't know...
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.,I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
You and Frank ever take a vacation?,Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
You don't seem to upset?,Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
What?,Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.,Promise?
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --,I understand, but Annie, please...
- See, what you can do for him --...,Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.,It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.,You!
I don't believe they'll expect that.,What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
Ha...,Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?,Sure. As long as she don't mind.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.,That's what some folks say.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...,And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
Would you let me ride your horse?,Have you talked to Tom about it?
I wouldn't let happen.,You know, you're a good kid.
Isn't it like, obvious?,Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.,I don't know if I can with my leg.
Sure?,Sure.
Grace, I need you to come with me.,No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
It's warmer than I thought.,You want to go to a movie tonight?
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.,Can I come? I'll start a fire...
You want to go down or stay along the river?,We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
"... and I said that"...,No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
Have you heard from Judith's parents?,No, not yet.
Dad! I can do it, OK?!,OK, OK.
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?,No, I'm just not that hungry.
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.,I understand...
Hey, darlin'.,Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.,I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.,What do you mean?
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...,...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.,Hackers of the World, Unite!
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?,What is it with this guy?
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?,Again?  Yeah sure.
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!,I want it.
Damn!,A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.,Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?,Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
Who's that?,Curtis.
What are you doing?,I'm taking over a TV network.
What did we learn in school today?,Revenge.
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.,And unpack.
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?,Nah. I don't play well with others.
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.,Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
Crash Override.,Never heard of you. Done anything?
Yo, showtime, showtime!,What's going on?
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!,What's this one eat?
That's a nice score for a girl.,Think you can do better?
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.,Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
Name your stakes.,If I win, you become my slave.
Kate, listen.,Uh, hold on...
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.,The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Why did he come to you?,I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
Alright, so what have we got?,Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
I can't believe they decided you won.,They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Uhhh.. ahahaha...,Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?,No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.,Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
There's a new virus in the database.,What's happening?
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...,Joey, Joey...
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?,Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.,I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
You think they're going to bust us?,Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.,Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
So what are we supposed to do?,Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
What the hell was that all about?,I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
Murphy kid turn you down?,I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.,So?
What is it? What's wrong?,Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
I'll take you down there.,All right.
Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?,Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.,You don't owe me anything.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.,Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
Is there another key?,I don't know!
Shit!,Brady! Come with us.
When did this happen?,Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.,Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.,Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
Mom, please,You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.,I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
Why not?,Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
Now where are you going?,Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.
I do.,Outside.
Who you calling?,Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?,Got it Earl.
Kido. It's four in the morning.,I can't sleep.
Sure it does.,I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.,I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?,Double scoops?
Jamie, wait for me.,This is great Rachel. Come on.
Can we go home soon Rachel?,Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?,I can't.
Rachel!,I've got you come on, go down.
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.,Dad, what's going on?
You remember Lindsay don't you?,Hi Jamie.
You won't look pushy.,Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
Hell of a night.,Its not over yet.
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.,Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
When he makes that call.,All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
Oh Christ. Doc...,Dear God.
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.,It isn't a man.
Thank you.,Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.  Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumon County, please to make your aquanauts.
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!,What's going on?
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.,Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
What?,What happened?
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.,Huh?
Why didn't you wait for me?,We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
Saving the treats for Bob?,Fun-ny. See you.
Shit!,I have a place for that.
Look.,Look where?
Hello?,Why did you hang up on me?
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.,Thanks.
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.,What's this big, big news?
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.,Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
I'm scared.,Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.,May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
Jesus!,You all right?
Sure...,Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
They could be.,I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
Hi, Laurie, what's up?,Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Are you coming over tonight?,Same time, same place.
Can we watch the monster movies?,Sure.
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner...",I don't like that story.
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.,Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
No...,Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
There WAS.,What did he look like?
Right.,And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?,Let's make more popcorn.
I'm scared!,There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.,I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!,Oh, listen...
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?,Are you really interested?
You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  I get the feeling you tune in to your environment.,Oh--
Yeah.,And then, uh, April...huh?
No, really, I really like him a lot.,No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
Wow, it's the red one?,Oh, it's magnificent!
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.,Right.
And you, you-you're going?,Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.,Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
Oh, what, what do you do?,I'm an architect.
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...,Well...
Mm-hm.,...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--,You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.,The hospital?  What kind of tests?
How ya doin', man?,I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?,Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
Hi, Dusty.,Hi.
...with the affiliates.,Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?,Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...,You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
No!  No...,No?
Yes.,Everything's okay? 
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?,Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
Well, thanks a lot.,Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Elliot!,I have been in love with you for so long.
I was looking for you.,I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.,Oh, don't say those words!
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.,What do you expect me to say?
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.,Not because of me, I hope.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.,Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Your guilt is because you feel the same.,Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.,Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
And you're in love overnight?,I care a great deal about him, yes.
Mm-hm?,Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.,I know!  I know!
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?,Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.,Was I?
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?,I don't know.
I want one with you.,Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.,You're not lost.
I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.,How can we be happy?
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.,I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.,Mom, come out!
Isn't it enough that I can love you?,Mmm...
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.,Because he likes you.
Elliot lusts after you.,Based on what?  You never even see him.
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?,Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Why?,Because I have to!
What are you going to use for money?!,I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!,No.
Oh, yes, you have!,No.
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!,Who is it?
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!,But who?  Where did you meet him?
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.,Oh...
You're just realizing this now?,Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
No.,I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.,Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
Come on.,Doesn't she look pretty?
I hope you tell her it was your idea...,Why?
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.,Oh...
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.,You are, Holly.  Stop it.
How is everything?,Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.,Here, you guys.  Open them up.
Yeah?,Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.,Yeah.
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...,Thanks, thanks.
Mh-hm.,That's a beauty!
I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--,Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
I want to experience childbirth.,With a, with a stranger?  With a--
Hey!,...from Mavis, also.
I know.  H-how much do you need?,Two thousand dollars.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?,Yeah.
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.,I should get a garter belt.
He's such a loser!,He's not a loser at all!
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.,Well, how about this?
He's married...,Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...,Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?,No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
I know, no--  I know.,I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.,Look, everything's going your way.
Well, that...th-that's fine.,But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.,Hmm!
My script?,It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful.",You're grateful, but you resent me.
Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...,You want some?
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.,But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.,Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Thanks for a swell time.,Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
At least I'm open to new concepts!,And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
God!,...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
Good.  How are you?,I'm fine.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?,Oh, nothing much.  You know...
Are you, are you out of work or something?,No, well...I've been trying to write.
I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...,Oh.  Oh.
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.,Oh, who cares?
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?,Yeah.
Hi.  How you doin'?,Okay.
Tch.,I don't know how you're gonna top that.
Hi.,...which I did not get.
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?,Take our literature...
A reward...,I'm going to tell you later....
Well.  Word gets around.,...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
Why me?,Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
We could skip the Gavotte.,Say it in English.
No, you're wrong about Verger.,Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.,And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
That's right.,Then I'm doing fine.
What, What, I can't hear you...,Are you <u>alright</u>...?
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...,...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...,...would you excuse me...?
Where was the call from.,Somewhere in Italy.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.,...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
If you would see him monument, look around you.,Show me the Pigs.
What do you want me to do?,Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.
I like Popcorn...,...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
What reaction?,Exactly.
He is...?,He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men ,Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
Look at this:,You seen John Brigham...?
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...,And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
What, you're saying she was overwrought.,That could be.
What'd you say, hon...?,I said sometime it gets so...
Waited too long, hon...?  ,How's your <u>child</u>?
Give it up, Evelda.,Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
Of course, Commendatore...,Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.,I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...,Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. ,I'll have them picked up.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- ,You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
And?  Then?,I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
Who does not?,If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
I require...,...yes, yes, yes...
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.,What is that that smells so wonderful.
...I'm sorry....?,...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
Why should <u>you</u> care?,It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....,Yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
Because you're going to help me plan a party.,You're going to <u>do</u> that?
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...,What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
No.  I want to buy a dog. ,What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
Give me your gun...,...<u>what</u>...?
I don't understand.,We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
I want the money.,What shape is the scar?
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....,No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.,Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.,I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
Thank you.,Or clear your windshield with it.
...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?,I know it well.
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...,....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
What're they on about?,They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...,...yes, yes, yes....
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?,I don't <u>think</u> so.
Then what brings you back?,I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...,...no...
Yes.,How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
I told that woman I'm an orphan.,...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.,...why?
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.,...yes...?
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.,When?
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.,And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.,Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere....
My encounter.,<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 
No really, keep talking, I ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...,Why are you...don't stop...why?
No.,That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.

Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.,Because you're an idiot.
All right.,So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.,I'll think about it.
Sawyer. Guess what today is?,Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
If you're going to openly be a bitch....,I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?

Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.,Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Maybe you should see a doctor.,Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.,Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.

It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?,No.
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?,Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.,Give me the clipboard.
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.,Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.

What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.,Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.,No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
"You might think what I've done is shocking...","To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad.",This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?,That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
Mute!,Next channel, darling.
What is this shit?,I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
Do you take German?,French.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.,They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.

You're still not listening! I'm not..,Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
If you'll excuse me......,No-o!
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.,You didn't say Simon Says.
How do you turn the fucker off?,You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.

Let's kick his ass.,Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though.
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?,I guess.
How was the funeral?,Superb.
Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.,Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.

My name is Gina!,It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.

Hint. It's not a geographical location.,I'm stumped.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.,You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?,No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
I understand... I won't-,No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.,Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?,Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
Must be nice.,What?
I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.,How much time off?

The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?,Thanks.

What's under that sheet...?,You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...,What things do you think you've done?
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...,Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
Are you ready?,I surrender...

Hey. Can I borrow something?,Uh... sure, Tawny... what?

Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is...,The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath?
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?,I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
The homeless!,How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!

Underbelly!,In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...,Lie, you mean...
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?,Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?,Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...,I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?,Uh, no.
Uh, er... I...,You were saying you don't want a million dollars.

Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...,John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...,It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.,Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.,That's not what I mean...
Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?,Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.
You just can't bear the idea of good news.,You're sitting on your ticket.
That too.,Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
We're piecing together different accounts and...,A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?,WHAT?  THEY FOUND WHAT?
She wants to quit?,She can't quit.
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.,Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
It's not unthinkable.,What?

I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.,An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?,We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.,Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
You didn't... get it on with him?,Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?,Okay.
Was that your dad?,Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?,Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
As long as you keep remembering why.,Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --,-- a sense of proportion.
Oh, great.,Yeah, that was easy.
Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.,Because you <u>were</u> pretty?
What happened?,Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
About what?,About us.
A man?  Was it a dream?,Uh huh.
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?,Uh huh.
I could take a cab on the way home.,Here, take this out to the table.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!,I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
Neil, calm down.,Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.,You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?,Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
Did you hear that?,What?
He made, you know, a remark.,Honey, are you okay?
Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.,Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?,Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!,Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.,There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.,Did you lock the garage door?
His secretary just confirmed.,Oh baby.
What -- what are you doing?,I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.,He wasn't there.
I think it's time I came home now.,That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
God, your sister's really hot.,Shut up.
Shit!,Put it out, man!
Are we gonna buy this house?,Do you have enough money?
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?,No.
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.,Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?,Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
Do you see a man?,No.
And this -- is the master bedroom.,Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.,Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.,Talk to me about what?
You didn't see this.  Understand?,Yes.
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.,What is it?
This ties in with Nash.,We don't have any proof of that.
He had to come from somewhere.,I think it was England.
Detective Bedsoe.,Lieutenant.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?,Central Park.
Where have you been for the last seven years?,Around.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?,No.
You sure?,He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.,Is that it?
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?,Aye.
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.,There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
The river.,That's all?
I'm leaving.,Leaving what?
Maybe myself.,Then it's worth the journey.
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.,I'm sure they will.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.,If it came down to it what would you do?
To ask her to dance.,She's the King's cousin.
I stood up first.,That doesn't matter.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.,She's a treasure she is.
Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.,I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
How comes it your are not afraid?,Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.,And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Leaving?  For how long?,You'll no see me again.
Do you love me, Conner?,Aye.
You guys are from the British museum, right?,No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
To talk to you.,I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
Yes.  How did you know?,A lucky guess.
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?,He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.,You got me.
I don't know.,Then how did he know your name?
Do you always walk around with a sword?,New York is dangerous place.
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.,About what?
You're not an easy person to get to know.,Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
How come you wanted to meet tonight?,I wanted to get to know you better.
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?,No.
Must you fight him?,He will not stop until it is over.
What now?,Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
It has to be.,And this?
You stayed here again last night?,I was working on the cataloging.
I am stronger than you, Highlander.,That's what the Kurgan said.
Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer.,Why did you wait?
You know it's not safe here for you.,I know.
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.,Me too.
Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.,My dreams died long ago.
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.,I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.,I can take care of myself.
You get anything on Smith?,Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.,Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.,It's happening right now.
Jen?  Are you all right?,She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
<u>Get on the floor</u>!,I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!,You won't die if you let me help.
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.,We're on foot.  We can't get away.
I have to tell you something --,We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!,Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.,Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?,That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.,That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.,We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
Talley?,I'm here.
You're a funny guy, Talley.,I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?,Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.,Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
It ain't been a good day, Chief.,Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
He needs a doctor.,Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
What about my father?,Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
We can take it with us.,You can't run with suitcases.
The cops are comin'!,I got the gasoline --
I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.,Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.,You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!,If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?
Can we talk some more when you get here?,We'll see you in a couple of hours.
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --,Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.,I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.,What I want is to help my father.
You gotta pee?,I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
Thanks for the shirt.,Whatever.
What happened?,Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
I can't go without Thomas.,All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
Are civilians inside?,He said something about a girl --
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.,What are we going to do about Mike?
I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.,Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?,Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
Louise?,Go, Chief.
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.,I know the one.
Chief, base.,Go.
Did you find Jane and Mandy?,Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.,Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
Let it go, Captain.,Goddamned small town bullshit.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.,Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?,Special Agent Jones.
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!,They've been in there all day.
The kids are in here!,Where's the office?
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.,Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.,If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --
I think so.,I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
Okay.,I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.,I thought they locked you in your room.
If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?,Yes, sir.
Can you open them?,I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
Are the disks still in your room?,No!  They're right here --
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.,You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!,I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
I guess we each have something the other wants.,I guess we do.
Paul, Paul, a moment please.,Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?,I'm sorry, it's a private function.
What happened?,They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
Excuse me?,The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
What is this about?,Let me see your identity card.
Please, I don't use guns.,There is nothing to it.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?,Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
Paul, you know who this is?,Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.,It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.,As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.,Watch everything? How? They are gone.
Satellites.,Satellites?
I will see what I can do.,I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.,I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.,Whiskey?
Your police are at the gate?,After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
You lie.,If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
I committed no war crimes.,Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
Very good.,I am always glad to see you Paul.
Very soon.,Thank God.
Are you sure this is the river road?,I saw the sign.
Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.,I would never do that.
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.,That will take time.
You have our cards.,No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.,They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.,I need a great favor.
It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.,I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.,Move? Where to?
This time the Militia will kill us.,They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.,We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
Let's have dinner first.,Of course.
Do something.,What?
They do not have your connections.,Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
What's the matter?,We're running out of beer and other supplies.
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.,Yes.
A Volkswagen.,A Volkswagen!
We are almost out of water.,We are almost out of everything.
Can I have your name again?,Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?,It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
That is why they call it coach?,Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.,Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?,When?
Paul. Are you alright?,We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.,Thank you, Roger.
Why the hurry, Roger?,Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
Moses, Moses Seradungu.,Can I help you?
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.,If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise.",So what stopped her?
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --,-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?,Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
Oh, for chrissake --,-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
Don't think it'll be a problem.,C'mon.
You're not my list.,I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
Melissa!,Ms. Marr!
What?,Is she alright?
I'm sorry --,-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.,I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
This thing's going nowhere.,If this is someone's idea of a joke --
'Less the place really is haunted.,Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --,-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
What is it? What's in there?,The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...
Hey! Where'd you guys go?,Left, goddamnit!
If you know where it is, get there!,Me? You've gotta be kidding.
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.,Prove it.
-- the stained glass --,-- yeah, we did that --
How you gonna manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome?,Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here.
-- you lose either way, Price --,-- listen to the man --
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!,Wait a minute... What are you saying?
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!,For chrissake give me a hand!
No. It's just trying to frighten us.,It's succeeding!
Where did it go?,Run.
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.,I don't do groups.
...Jesus H. Christ.,So where's the party?
Then what the hell are we doing here?,How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?,Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --,-- the sadistic prick --
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?,Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --,-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
-- wit...nesses --,-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.,Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.,What?
Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?,I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
Do something!,Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
I'm ready now.,Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
-- even if I give you a million as well?,Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
Sorry.,Good way to get your head blown off.
-- the window and door grates --,-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --,-- confirming everything we already know --
Then tell me, please -- help me...!,Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Houston, I think we may have a problem.,Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
Problem where? Looked good to me.,"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...,-- it wasn't me.
But the million bucks each, that's for real?,It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!
Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?,I can't comment until I get paid.
Oh, no.,What's going on?
Ghosts killed your father?,Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
And you think it's in there?,Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
There is something very not normal going on here!,This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
Excuse me?,He would have been back by now.
Did you find something?,I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster.  They had a daughter.  Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide.
We don't have proof of that.,The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
Town records are coming up now.,What will they tell you?
How did you meet Dr. Shea?,There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.,Yes.  It was.
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?,Yes.
My angel!,I'm scared!
Your father doesn't love us anymore!,What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
She's here.,Where is she now?
Good night Angel...,Good night daddy.
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.,Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
What's the matter?,Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
Oh come on...,I just, I don't know...
What will Aubrey think?,Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
I wish I knew more about her.,Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...,Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?,Should I...
Maura, what is this!,We're not going.
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.,Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
I think we should do it.,We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
What do you mean, unfortunately?,We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?,Before.
...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.,Oh, that's nice...
Well it's nice that you were there for her.,I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
Your daughter's been taken.,What!
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.,So what should we do, father?
Concentrate!  She can hear you!,Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
She's coming back.  Keep talking!,Come back to us honey!
What was she afraid of?,Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.,And what would you do?
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?,Runic?
Do you mind if I borrow it?,Not at all, if it can help.
There's something in there.,What?
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.,Jesus Christ ...
I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.,Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.,And what is ... this frozen moment?
I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.,I don't know ...
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.,Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
What?,No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.,Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
I figured I'd make breakfast.,Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...,Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.,Would you know this store again?
Terri?,Buying some drugs, alright?
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.,No.  We want ...
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.,What else came with it?  Anything still here?
You gonna buy?,I don't know.  Maybe.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.,A prize?  For what?
Yes.,Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?,Fuck you!
A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire.,Hey, that's what makes the world go round.
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.,Really?
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...,I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
I miss you too.,That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
A girl?  Anyone I should know?,Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
Yeah right.  Look ...,Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.,Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
Oh thank God, you're dead...,It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they...
That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?,Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
That's your definition of "Hard?",Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...,Sure.  That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.
Hmmmm.....,Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.
The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.,Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...,There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...,Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
You got about five minutes and change.,5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
"You could be swinging on a star.",Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..,Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things.
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.,But I said I was sorry....
We're going in from the ground floor.,Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt","How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.,Too-do-loo, babe.
Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?,Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....,As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos.",Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
What the hell....,You're supposed to be dead!
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me.",God go with you, sister.
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.,Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.,Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.,I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....,I'll bring my entire repertoire...
And I'll bring my entourage...,Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
Hudson, don't you understand...,And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
Where did you get this?,You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
Way to go, Anna.,When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.,Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
Cat got his tongue?,Actually he never told us what it was.
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!,Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.,I guess that's a no.
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...,The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.,You certainly do.
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.,For God's sake, chain this convict.
Don't I know you...,You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
I can't believe this.  I'm in fucking Russia, or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.  I never thought I'd say "I'm just in this job for the money."  Sad. Any last immature quips?,No.  But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?,Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
Ol' satchel-butt...,I know they're gonna buy that stock --
-- and she's dynamite!,But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
What a horrible little person.,Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
Cigarette?,No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.,Oh, no, really, I --
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?,Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
Well, I --,Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.,Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Well, she probably had a deadline...,Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
Confused?,Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
Oh, is that it!,Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
...You do?,I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
...Huh?,You know, on farm route 17.
...The people look like ants.,Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?,Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
You mean you know about this?,Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...,Worked in a watch factory?
...You son of a --,Norville!
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!,Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --,You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
Ya know, entry level!,Tell me about it.
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.,What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
...What's your pleasure, buddy?,Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?,I --
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!,Yeah, but, buddy --
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!,Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
Awwww, buddy --,And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!,We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
But, Buzz, you know I never --,And Sid says you stole it!
Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.,Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --',-- tough titty toenails!
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?,I haven't had --
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!,Oh my God, sir!
I got gas, Bennie.,Yeah, tell me about it.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.,Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
She finds him.,She sits down.
Yellowstone.,Old Faithful.
She's got other problems, of course...,...Her mother needs an operation...
She isn't!,She is!
Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.,She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.,What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.,You mean a figurehead.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.,But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
I think you need some help.,I'm afraid so.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.,You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?,I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
Mrs. Rand.,Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.,Thank you.
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.,I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.,Yes -- on the boat.
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.,Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.,I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?,Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?,I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?,Of course, Wes.
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...,Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.,But she's not dead, Wes.
It is not beautiful.,You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
I heard someone crying -- a woman --,A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.,If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?,Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?,Of course not!
A mental case?,I'm sorry...
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.,Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.,I love Fort Holland.
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.,What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.,It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
What about her?,In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
In other words, I'm on trial.,I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
Benjie!,Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?,Why shouldn't she be?
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...,So maybe you'll come too?
The Halfords have invited us again this year.,You want to go?
I... I think I am...,You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --,No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?,I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.,So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
What's for dessert?,See for yourself.
Don't be dim.,Elena, what are you're talking about?
It's a starting place.,Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.,Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
Damn it, Ben --,I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
You're not going to --,I'm not.
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?,Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
So how's school treating you?,All right.
Anyone special? You know...,Hnnn.
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?,Yeah.
About?,Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?,Libbets. Libbets Casey.
It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --,Ben--
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?,Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?,That's besides the point.
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.,I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?,I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.,You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Who?,Nobody.
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.,Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.,Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
I'm thinking of going back to school.,Social work?
Here you are.,Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers --,I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
Now you are being rude.,And you're still trying to get me into bed.
I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?,I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.,See ya.
You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff.,Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?,Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.
Awesome sleet and rain.,Major.
Jesus, Jim!,Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
It's not packed with explosives, is it?,No!
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.,Great, thanks for the tip.
Frankie opens them with his teeth.,Hey, it's a sellable skill.
Yeah but you don't even know me really.,Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
How do you know this shit?,They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?,Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
Where you going?,Out.
Want some gum?,Sure.  Twinkie?
Why did you -- with Sandy?,I don't know.
Charles.,Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
Hello, Charles.,Greetings, Charles.
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?,Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Her name's Libbets.,Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
Mikey was looking for you.,Yeah? See ya.
Well, you can...,Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
All my model planes.,The ones you built?
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.,What are you doing?
We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?,Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.
It feels warm.,One more shot?
Yes, sir.,That's all, for now.
My partner...,Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
I want you to check this out, Ellie.,We already did.
Oh, I shouldn't have...,It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
Not really.,Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
I'll call him now.,First I need a copy of the key.
Good.,And something else that might interest you.
No.,One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
Randy Stetz?,That's right.
You know my plan of action.,To do nothing.
No way.,Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.,Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
Fred Duggar?,No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
Stuff.,What kind of stuff?
I told you I don't remember.,After that she left the party to go to him.
I don't know.,You don't know.
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!,Who?
My arm!,Who?
I'm sorry?,I said you're going to get a phone call.
Oh?,Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
You're not following procedure.,Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
So you have the answers...,Ah! You have questions?
I have not spoken to him...,And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.,You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
No, my beloved, my child.,If you say so. You are innocent.
And the vampires of the Theatre?,Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
Where is she? Where's Claudia?,Follow me - that way - through my cell -
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.,Louis, I swear I did not.
I want some more.,It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.,I have. Or there would be twice as many.
And if I cut my hair again?,It will grow back again!
What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!,Does it?
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.,Is that supposed to frighten me?
Stop pestering me then!,Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
I want more.,What have you done?
How did you learn to write, Claudia?,The way I learn everything. By watching you.
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.,And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.,And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
It can't be -,It is! Take the back stairwell -
You don't remember? Or you never knew.,It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
Or her, or her - or any of them?,Claudia, you torture yourself.
But this can't be real. This is nonsense.,Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
This is no performance.,And no one knows but us...
This is monstrous!,Yes, and very beautiful.
How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?,Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
They would have killed you -,Then my luck would have changed.
You want death? Is it death you want?,Yes...
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?,And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?,Give it to me!!!
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.,You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?,I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Did I hear a yes?,Yes...
Come, you're going to feed now.,I want a woman.
Dear God, what have I done?,You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...,Fascination...
Have you ever been caught?,Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.,Paris? You came from Paris?
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.,Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?,I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.,You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.,Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...,If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat.
I have to go now Lestat...,You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.,I tried...
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.,So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
You followed me here, didn't you?,Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
How did you do that?,The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
You said the slave had a crucifix...,Oh, that rumour about crosses?
The story about stakes through the heart?,The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
You loved Yvette...,Can a vampire feel love?
You loved your wife, surely.,I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
What can I do for you?,Checking in...Karla Wilson.
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.,Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
I want off this island.,Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.,Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
No means yes.,Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
He does work hard.,Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
Oh!,Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
No.,Yes.
Cancer in a box.,No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.,I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.,Then, we fight --
I don't know...,Come on, you can make it.
Ray, I can't...,Can't what?
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...,This weekend?
Never do that again.,Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.,Who?
Don't kill me --,Wait, it's Nancy --
The shower again?,It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?,I'm okay.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.,Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
There was a body! I swear it!,Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Come on. We're gonna be okay.,Did you get help?
I trusted you.,We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.,I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.,I'll talk real slow.
Is there a problem here?,Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
Oooh, the mainland --,Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.,Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.,I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
You think that's a good place to hide?,I don't know, but I'm starving.
To a great weekend --,Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
Come on, it'll be fun.,Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
Why? He can't help us.,He's probably the only one who can help us.
Jeez, that's a full carat --,How much?
He leave you?,No. I shot him.
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --,And so could you -- crazy fool.
Can't talk right now.,See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.,So why are you still here?
I need your advice  something has happened  Mr.  Jacks ,Drunk again?
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.,I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.,I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
There was some trouble here the villagers on the mainland -this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.,All the graves?
Where's Thea?,I think she went to bed  I saw her going toward the house
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!,Poor Cathy --
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.,If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?,I don't know now without my father.
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.,I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill  or frightened.,How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.,In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --,I do not know him, but I have seen him.
What is it -- what are you talking about?,You have forgotten my last name?
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?,It was, the plague
I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.,Whet do you mean?
Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.,How do you know what my father thought - -
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life you've ruined mine ,You were father's secretary - I never thought - -
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.,That your father and I 
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours  but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.,Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people - a cataleptic!,You wouldn't tell that 
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.,This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.,Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.,Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Your daughter is ill.,She's not too well.
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl ,Thea?
There is something evil about her.,Oh, now  now look here 
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?,In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
Theodosia --,Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
Well, tell, him.,I can't.
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.,It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.,Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
George . . .,Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
Good morning, sir.,Carter  bank examiner.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.,Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
I told you  I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.,Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
What'd you say?,I said I wish I'd never been born.
I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.,You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.,Made what?
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?,Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
You know where he lives?,Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?,Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
Where's Mary?,Oh, well, I can't . . .
Poor George . . . Sit down.,Sit down? What are . . .
Where? I don't see a thing.,Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
A boy?,That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission  I mean  might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir  and people are beginning to talk.,What's that book you've got there?
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.,Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?,The Building and what?
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.,They went out of business years ago.
Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.,All right.
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?,That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
Oh  Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.,Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
It will?,Uh-huh.
Old college graduate now, huh?,Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
Big  see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand . . . a great big one.,I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?,No charge.
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.,Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Oh, no  you don't feel so good.,I'm all right.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.,Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Hmmmm . . .,Nice girl, Mary.
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.,Well, she's not crazy about him.
You're not paid to be a canary.,No, sir.
Anything I can do back here?,No.
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.,I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
I know it's soon to talk about it.,Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.,Come on, George, let's hurry.
Do me a favor, will you, George?,What's that?
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?,Oh, yeah, yeah.
Two cents worth of shoelaces?,She was here first.
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.,Hello, Vi.
Where are you going?,Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.,Huh?
George, can I see you for a second?,Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
When?,About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
Holy mackerel!,And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
Those Rockefellers!,Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Now look, did you buy anything?,Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
Just a minute  just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . Why, in the twenty-five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why . . . Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You . . . you said . . . What'd you say just a minute ago? . . . They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!,I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.,You like it? I'll send you a box.
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?,Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.,I'd like to do that.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.,All right, sir.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.,What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?,I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.,That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
A new magazine! I never saw it before.,Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
Me?,Uh-huh.
Do I look as funny as you do?,I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Well, why don't you say it?,I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Eighteen.,Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Oh, no.,Come on, tell me.
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.,Thank you.
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.,Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
George . . . George . . . George . . .,Mary . . .
George Bailey lassos stork.,Lassos the stork! You mean you . . . What is it, a boy or a girl?
Where's your coat and hat?,Left them at the office.
What is it, a sore throat or what?,Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.,What plates?
Wheee!  Faster!,How fast is enough?
No.,Good.  It's terrible.
Putz -- that won't be for hours.,I was counting on hours.
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.,Shells and lobsters and stuff?
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.,Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
The lighthouse?,No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
Throw it.,Sean!  Catch it!
Hey!,Over here!
Good morning!,Aren't you off-duty?
What about that camera?,What camera?
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.,The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
Untie that rope.,Please.  It's my job.
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.,Hey, come on....
Mike?  Is that you?,Pop.  I'm sorry.
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.,All of us thank you, okay?
May I have this dance?,Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.,You don't make enough.
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.,After we've looked, we'll talk.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.,Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Sean's awake.,Door's locked.
Eat Cheerios.,What're you guys doing today?
Thank you.  I'll tell him.,For me?
Oww!,Careful.  What's wrong?
All summer?,He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
Sean's asleep.,That's great too.  Gorgeous.
That you were fired.,Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!,Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....,...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
What're you doing?,Going out.
What is it?  What's the matter?,Mike's out there.
Yeah?  Then what?,Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.,Shouldn't he be at home?
Hi Dad.,Hiya yourself.
They made me go with them.,Sure they did....
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.,Now I really want to see it.
How old is your cousin?,Seventeen.  She's a senior.
My cousin will be here tomorrow.,Great.
Maybe it's gone.,They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
Take a break for a minute, okay?,Huh?
But first, a little juice....,And second?
Right after, the Kids went out?,What Kids?  Who went out?
Hurry, please.,What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?
That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!,Name it.
He's got to help or it won't work.,Sean, baby, please....
Yeah.,Would you take him?
Wave to my son.,How the hell do we get him down. from there?
Oh, my God....,What the hell is he doing?
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.,Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over.  We have to deal with the consequences.
Go on, Doctor.,No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.,I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start.
It's Miller time!,You buying?
Pre-opening jitters.,I guess.
You called, Doctor?,Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
It's his work.,He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?,I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Not enough loving.,Get out of here!
Honey... you all right?,No.
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.,That's a lot of ground to cover.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.,Let's not talk about that now, okay?
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.,Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you.
You all right?,I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
How the hell did it get in here?,God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
You want me to stay?,Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
Mmmm... you smell good.,You don't.
Come on!,You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
Michael, you don't have to go down there.,I want that shark, Kathryn.
Are you okay?,I'm  fine.
Nobody told me.,I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.,Yes, aren't we all.
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.,Make this quick!
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.,I thought they were clever.
I told you, something's upset them.,Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.,You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
Philip.,Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
Well, Doctor.  You've got your shark.,Thanks to you.
I think they'll come out now.,They still seem nervous.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.,Massachussettans aren't.
Sean, do you have herpes?,No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!,The one that goes underwater?
Yes, it's great!,No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Come on, it's fun!,Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
Isn't this fun!,Can hardly wait to do it again.
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!,Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
Make sure you put this back.,Aww, can't I keep it?
Watch it, Brody.  You're ruining the shot.,Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  Why don't you throw in another shark?
South Georgia, Antarctica.,Oh...
Reach for the limit I always say.,I'll remember that, my Lordship.
How far away is filter number four?,Five hundred yards.
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?,You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
I'll go with you.,No way.
He's big, Hutton.  You never saw anything so big.  Watch yourself.,Always do.
That's impossible.,I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Let us know as soon as you have anything.,Right, Mike.
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.,... I'll go to McDonalds.
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.,It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
Sure.,No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.,I wouldn't mind going down with her.
You want to show this?,Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....,Watch me, Grandma....
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....,My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
Where are you going?,Nowhere....
I've always wanted to ride one of those....,No way....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....,I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
No fair, I'm not armed.,Then don't come any closer.
Turn it off....,No....
Close the door.,They're at the beach....
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....,But it went away...We would have known....
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....,I'm not on vacation....
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....,Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?,What difference does it make?  It's here....
Are you all right?,Adds flavor....
Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....,He heard that.
A big one....,A small one...Your brother won't be here....
Don't be late.,I won't....
I like Grandma's cooking....,Thank you....
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.,It's not nice to be evasive.
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.,I'll miss you....
It's late....,Trying to write our report....
You look tired....,I'm fine....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....,There's nothing to worry about....
Flies the plane....,Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.,I always listen to my feelings....
I don't know how....,No one does till they learn....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....,One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
What's wrong?,Nothing....
You the architect?,I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....,She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
Grab your socks....,You sure you know how to do this.
Keep it steady....,Aye, aye, Captain....
Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....,Good news travels fast....
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....,What's that....?
Can't this thing go any faster?,Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
Come on, Hoagie....,All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
I don't know what the hell to say....,You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?,Inch by inch....
She has good days and bad...I don't know....,She's a tough lady....
Let me speak to Ellen....,I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
Stop farting around....,Stop busting my hump....
We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate....,If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....,I made them, man....
Hey!,Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Bad boy....,I didn't do it on purpose....
A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....,It's not a bad life, Jake....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....,You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
When I got the grant.....,When I signed on....
And it's always worked?,So far..
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....,What do you know about him?
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....,Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....,Maybe it's gone....
'A Moray eel....','Snuck up on me....'
Shove it....,You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
Stop that!,You don't like my voice...?
If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio.,Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....,If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
Your equipment has crapped out again....,My equipment doesn't crap out....
Who grows more beautiful....,Here comes the cow ca-ca....
Woman has taste....,When he has a pillow over his head....
Be my guest. What you got?,Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
Why so coy about the word "frozen"?,Because, don't get into it ...
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..,Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
You want my advice?,Maybe?
Someone bet me a dollar ..,A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
What do you mean?,Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?,Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..,No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
Why?,I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.,I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
You believe me, don't you?,What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
Stop it.,I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
She wasn't lying about the van.,Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
Sure.,You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.,I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.,Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
Jesus. What are you doin?,I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
Have you got a print from the hand?,No, Sir.
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..,It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.,Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?,And did they?
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.,Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?,No .. But we have a theory ..
Kid told me he didn't take it?,Maybe he's lying to you?
Yes, Sir.,As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?,I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
Did Amber have a dog?,Yes.
Are you wearing a uniform?,No.
Are you married?,Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
You just asked me to ask you questions.,I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears.",Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.,He said that? What else did he say?
Just your age.,Which is what?
Has he got your aunt's address?,I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?,Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight.,I'm going back to the institute.
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..,Why does he want to kill me?
What are you doing, Travis?,I been told to take your car in, Sir.
You got a warrant for this?,Yes, Sir.
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?,No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
What does that mean?,You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
Is that Margie?,I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
He's happy, darlin ..,I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..,Whass going on here?
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?,A derelict.
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!,Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.,I know about the bachelor party.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!,Okay, this is working.
Who said anything about "loser?" Where do you get this word "loser?",I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I meant something else.  When do you want to leave?
Well, no you didn't --,You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --,Could you just stop moving?
Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --,Look, I don't want a --
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --,Listen to me, it's over.
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?,Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
He's asleep, right?,Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?,I see what you're saying.
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.,"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!,Bill, Rod, wait --
Can I help?,Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
Oh no.,No no. I knew.
That took guts.,Same to you.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.,Hello?
Hey you.,Hi.
Too bad.,Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
I'm working with you because of that memo...,Mission... statement...
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.,Plus, you could use that commission.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.,I'm relieved you said that.
Well -- this would be goodnight.,Good night.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.,Same to you.
Oh God.,Easy, easy --
Another time, okay Dorothy?,Fine, I just --
Sure you're okay to drive this?,This rig? Phht.  No problem.
Why do you love me?,Why do you love me?
It's my fault.,What --
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --,Of course I know --
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.,Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.,Thank you.
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?,It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.,So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --,We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?,I gotta get back to Cushman.
You're loving me now, aren't ya?,I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
What are you doing with me, Rod?,Huh?
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.,Oh my God.
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?",Uh, not today, but --
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.,I understand your anxiety.
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.,Great word.  Towel?
You're telling me to dance.,No, I'm saying to be --
I'll get you some quick work --,Good deal, man.
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.,Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.,I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
I'm sorry I asked.,No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
Why not --,Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
I don't want to be friends anymore.,Fine.
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.,Well.  Good luck with that --
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.,Tell me, and then you can sleep.
Oh, tell the story.,--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
Marcee --,What DO you stand for???
Cronin's okay for lunch?,Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?,You'll lose.
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...,I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
Hi.,Hi Ray.
Let's go the zoo.,Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.,Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
I won't tell.,We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
Show me the animal, Jerry!,Right up ahead, buddy --
He should have kept his head tucked down.,Shut up!!!
ERRR-IIIC!,And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...,We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
We can't just...,Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
Sorry.,Nothing you haven't seen before.
You hate to swim.,People change.
You look good.,So do you.
What did you say!,Just drop it Paul!
That's him. Thats Eric!,I filmed this the morning they left.
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...,Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
Udesky.,He's this way.
I don't know. I don't have it with me.,When did you have it last?
I don't remember,Think.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.,How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
He could have died.,But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.,I would completely support that.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.,How low?
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.,What about Eric?
Where's Dad?,Just hold on.
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.,I didn't know, there were two islands.
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?,Sure.
That does sound lucky.,It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
They never got that big.,Baryonyx?
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.,Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
Hmm?,He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.,The last of my breed.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.,You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?,The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?,Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
Hmmm.,Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
Well that's good.,But you never came across just one.
Billy!,It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.,Just a little bit too much, I think.
It matches the pictures.,It certainly does.
You hear something?,No.  I feel something.
You are an academic.,Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
Is there an antidote?,Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!,Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
Resentful.,When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
I didn't know you -- weren't well.,It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.,You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B.
I don't believe you.,Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .,After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?,Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
Are you looking for a problem?,Everyone, keep your voices down!
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!,I want to see the nesting ground!
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!,Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.,I don't even know this woman.
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.,My vacation is over in a week.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?,No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
Dad!,Come on!
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?,Okay.
Where do you think you're going?!,To collect my fee.
How close do you have to be?,Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
You rally think this'll draw the parent?,I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.,Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
What is?,The velociraptors.
It's... behind... us.,It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.,You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.,It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
What's he got in there?,Piss.
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?,Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
There' no reason for name calling.,Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!,No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
What are they?,I don't know.
I think she's with Sarah!,DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
So that others would know about this place?,Why should they?
Because it exists.,It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.,So the truth is more important to you than your life?
How many rounds did you find for that weapon?,Four, counting the one in the chamber.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.,Funded by whom?
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?,They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
Ian.  It's guano.,What?
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.,You think this is all a joke?
-- way we could safely --,Oh, no!
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.,Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
Hold it down, Nick!,I'm trying!
If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.,Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.,So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
How many lines of code are there?,Uh - - about two million.
But would we get the phones back?,Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
You shouldn't use my name.,Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
Oh, I'll get 'em all.,Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?,The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.,Are you sure?
Once we have control again we - -,Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -,Look.
And what are those?,Small versions of adults, honey.
Constantly sick.,Not just every six weeks.
- - and swallows fresh ones.,And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.,You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
Come on, let's go.,We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
Okay, I'm on channel two.,Stick to my heels.
Oh my God.  Aw, God.,The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
That's right.  Will break through.,I get ah - -
Uh - - thumb!  The same way.,It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
I can't see.,What are we looking for?
Are they heavy?,Yeah.
I read your book.,Oh, yeah - - great.
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.,Really?
I threw up.,That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?,Yes it is.
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?,No.
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.,This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --,I doubt it.
So you two dig up dinosaurs?,Try to!
Where does he think he's going?,When you gotta go, you gotta go.
Oh my God!,We gotta do something.
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.,Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.,What does he mean by "target audience"?
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.,After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
It's safe.,Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
Tim, Tim, Tim....,Oh, I hate the other kind.
Watch how it eats!,Please!
Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch. One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two, three - -,You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?,Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
What works?,Phone security systems, everything works.  You ask for it, we got it!
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, thats all it is!,John, John.
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.,I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.,I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....,I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
Sustain winds 45 knots.,Tell them when they get back to the cars.
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!,Excellent.
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -,Why did you do this?
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?,What if we fall?  I hate trees.
I hate trees!,They don't bother me.
No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!,They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!,Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.,Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
I think we're lost.,You have a map.
I didn't think there were any houses up here...,You learn something new every day. Let's go.
Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...,Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
Two.,I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.,That's my job.
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?,I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard...",Fuck you.
What's going on?,Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
It's still on.,What?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.,Compared to this guy... amateur.
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...,Who's chest?
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.,Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.,Video store?
You watch this garbage?,This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction...
"Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave.",A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
He wets the bed?,I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake,None of that's true?
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.,I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
How long will he need to be asleep?,We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum, six hours ideal.
Fascinating.,Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
Where's he going?,I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.,Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
-- Merely in the interests of order.,The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?,-- Small.
Just what you've published.,-- In magazines nobody reads.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?,In a manner of speaking.
Will you do me a favor then?,Another one?
The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.,I gave it to him yesterday.
Did you see him?,I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.,He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.,Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?,Yes.
You wanted to see me, sir.,Sit down, Kafka.
You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.,... My ... social situation?
To do my work well, I have little time for --,You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
I did not realize it was obligatory.,Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
No, sir.,Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
Was there something else?,No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.,Yes.
What's funny?,This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
When I have no reason to doubt.,The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
You almost married recently, didn't you?,Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.,I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.,People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.,Why were you given notice?
Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.,First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.,Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
Gabriela! -- you did get away.,I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.,I -- I found your jailer.
I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.,No -- not this time.
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?,Wednesday.  We left the office together.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.,Well -- other departments are, yes.
He wasn't a lonely man, though.,What makes you think so?
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.,That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
Maybe it's true then what she said.,What did she say?
For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors.,-- Just doing our job.
That's <u>mad</u>.,-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.,What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.,It usually is.
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?,He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?,Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
Where do our records go to in the Castle?,We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
I could always apply there.,It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
Ludwig.,Oskar.
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.,We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.,My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...,Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap.
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.,It's ... lovely.
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -,Father ... Father!
Holy God! The mummy walks!,How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
It's the same image - Kong!,Leave it, Ann.
Oh Jesus ... you took it.,Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
Barricade the gates! Quick!,Jack!...  Jack!
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!,That's your monkey, Denham.
Are you gonna start it up?,Yeah.
Enjoy.  Well --,It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
I do not love him.,You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
Why isn't he locked up?,We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
-- We can talk --,-- Yes.
You have no idea what I'm talking about.,Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?,Yes.
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?,If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
What about?,My name's John Klute.
You said that.,I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --,Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --,Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.,OK.
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?,I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.,Is that what you gave him?
What're you gonna do next?,Try some other ways. 
You said it was!,No, I said what did you think.
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.,Well --
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?,Yeah, you got to me.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?,Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.,I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
The same as Jane McKenna.,Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
Just let me know when you are going out and where --,What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?,Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
Is that all you have to say?,What am I supposed to say?
Where'd you spend last night?,With Trina.
Why couldn't you stay here with me?,Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.,Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.,Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.,They don't scare me any more.
Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?,No. I'm sore.
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?,It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.,Well there's a couple --
I'm sorry. I don't understand.,It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
You must be discouraged.,Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
That who?,Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.,Someone's been doing all these things.
John, how are you?,I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.,Goodbye, Pete.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?,Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.,I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.,Has she talked with you since prison?
No.,Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?,Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
Are you closing the case?,No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.,Welcome to the... 
Greatest.,Greatest...
Show.,Show...
What about my orange juice?,Right.  One O.J. coming up.
Will she pick me up after school?,No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
Daddy?,Yeah?
Is mom ever coming back?,You mean for good?
I don't think so.,Oh...
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.,Good night.
Wow!,You like it?
Is this really your desk?,Yep.
Did mommy ever see this?,No, she never did.
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.,Why does he decide?
Your mom.,Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.,Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
Objection!,Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?,Yes.  Very much.
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.,Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?,Objection!
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?,Eight, almost nine years.
Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.,Thank you.  I have no further questions.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.,Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--,Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
A heavy drinker?,No.
Did he ever fail to provide for you?,No.
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.,Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.,I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
I've seen him.,You have?
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.,Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.,Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--,Ted, do you love him?
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...,What?
Only can I still see him?,No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
Hey, what's the rush?  C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.,Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--,Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--,That's my decision, Ted and that's final.
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.,Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.,Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
Yeah?,I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
And?,I'm going to take it.
Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.,I know....I know.
Oh, Christ!,The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
John?,Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.,Ted?  Are you there?
Yeah.,Any prospects?
Hostile?  Me?  Thelma, I'm not hostile.  I am anything but hostile.  But if you want to know what I am.  I'll tell you what I am. What I am is, I am hurt.  I am very hurt.  And I just want to know one thing, okay?  Just one thing ...Why?  That's all I want to know...Why?,Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?,No.
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.,Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?,Got it.
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?,No.  I don't think so.
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?,Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
Not the way to talk to people.,Can I do anything I want?
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.,Will you buy the sheep for me?
I will buy them for you.,Can I free the prisoners?
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.,I will not approve it.
Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.,The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
With much bloodshed.,I am afraid.
Yes.,Time to study.
Holiness?,Yes.
I will be back in a few days.,How many?
Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.,You could buy them.
Do I have money?,What do you think?
Is that big?,No. Not very big.
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?,He warned about the future of Tibet.
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.,Ask whatever you will.
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.,So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.,Britain?
One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".,Where is that?
I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.,Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.,Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.,But you will always be here?
Do you think I must?,You decide.
What does the butter spot feel like?,Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
Things change, Kundun.,Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.,But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
This is Britain.,Ahh.
This is Tibet. And this is China.,Ahh.
You have grown up very good.,And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?,Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?,<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.,He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
And what would he do come winter?,They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
Around here.  Yeah.,If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.,No!!  Out!
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--,I coulda shot you, you--
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.,No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Promise you won't kill me, first.,I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
Asia?  How... how could he get here?,Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.,Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?,Raincheck.
No!,I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--,'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
No way.,Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
Where?  Where?,Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.,'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.,And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
He was an Indo-pacific.,Are you sure?
<u>Jack</u>!,I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.,Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
How big do the bears get?,Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
Oh my God.,What?
Same thing from Fish And Game.,<u>Something's</u> in that water.
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.,I'd be able to see something.
You flew up here because your boss--,I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.,That's probably good.
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.,I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.,Excuse me?
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?,Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
Thing we can lift it?,Maybe.  Don't mush it.
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.,<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Calm down.,You calm down!
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?,Alright, Jack!
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?,He's floating.  Take it home.
Watch out!!,Keep firing!
Get him onto shore.,He heeds a tourniquet.
You think?,Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.,Good thinking.
Are they feeding?,Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
Now I'm gonna puke.,<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
If you get a safe shot...,I'll take it!
He just came up screaming.,Did he say anything?
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.,And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
I wouldn't.,I'm fine, thank you.
You're sort of a rude person.,It's just that--
They don't believe her.,Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?,I asked you to be nice to him.
What was that?,I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.,Look.
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.,What?
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.,She's worried about the cow now.
Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...,A jerk.
This is what we do?,I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.,Wild guess.
<u>You</u>?,It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
<u>You</u>?,It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.,Kelly--
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...,Backstabber?
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?,Never cock. Just squeeze.
Boy, is that smart...,Why does she keep repeating the name?
Lecter said a lot of things.,He's here, Ardelia.
What girl?,The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.,Where?
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.,I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?,Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?,Jack Gordon.
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?,No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?,Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.,Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?,Yes sir.
Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here.  Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.,There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
Why?,What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
Are you finished?,He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...,They weren't there. Get close-ups.
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.,I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
You seem pretty sure of that.,Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.,I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.,You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.,He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it...
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?,Not lately. But maybe someday.
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.,"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?,We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?,Yes.
I have no doubt of it.,Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.,Then please - do this test for me.
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.,What's that, Dr. Lecter?
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.,Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.,Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?,Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.,I never thought about it.
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.,Who killed your patient?
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.,Was it a butterfly?
Go, Doctor.,What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
On what basis would they reject him?,The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?,Yes, Doctor. Please.
He kills w-,No! That's incidental.
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.,No. We just -
I heard a strange sound...,What was it?
Brave Clarice. Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?,Yes. I'll tell you.
I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem.,Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.
Of course it counts. How do you play?,Officer Starling. Welcome back.
My God, you've grown up.,We leave in the morning?!
Why didn't you bury those people?,Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
The Ottawa are gone.,Why did they turn back?
They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.,I'm sorry.
Much further?,Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?,Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?,Because what I am interested in is right here...
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.,No. I will find you.
Are we safe?,Maybe...
Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...,...never doubt what you are doing.
Will you go back to England?,I have nothing to go back for.
My letter...,There was none!
Some say that's the way of it.,"Some"?
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...,Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
Will you consider that?,Yes. Yes, I will.
Yes. Go ahead.,What the bloody hell plan is this?
How far is it, scout?,Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?,No.
That is the truth!,I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
How long?,Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.,Your enemy...
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?,We'll see in the morning...
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.,What did you see, Major?
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.,Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.,You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis. 
First rank! Second rank! Present arms! ,Fire!!!
Shoulder arms!  Present! ,Fire!!!
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?,I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.,My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.,That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.,And this?
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...,Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...,Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
Their arms?,They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
Are you planning on working tomorrow?,Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
Why Sixpack?,It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...,Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
We're getting out of here just in time.,There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
Jesus Christ...,Can you fix it?
Your suit, Becky!,Just get in yours!
You did good...,What?
The internal monitors read normal.,Where's Doc?!
No!,It bit me!
Give me a readout, DeJesus.,Ahhhh!
Made your million, yet?,Not yet.
I'm telling you, it's the suits!,Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.,The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?,Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
Yes sir...,Hook's on 24...
What the?...,Russian.
Listen to it for Christsake.,Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here...
What's going on?,It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
Burritos...Enchiladas...,Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.,'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
How far away is she?,Two hundred meters.
We've got to get him to the infirmary.,What are you going to do to him?
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?,It's had a meal.
Clear for pickup.,Let's hope it holds.
Don't spend all day down there.,Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?,Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.,Right.
Bitch!  Look what you did!,Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
What's wrong, did you miss me?,Hardly.
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?,I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
Bacon, see what we got.,Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!,That inspires confidence, that does.
Well?,Well what?
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.,Apart from those shotguns.
I thought this was a pub.,It's a Samoan pub.
I don't know what you mean.,There were two old guns there; where are they?
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .,Yeah, Bazza, what?
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?,No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?,Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?,You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
Nope.,Can I help?
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.,Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
Have you counted the money?,Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
They were going to pay, then?,It looks like t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
Hello, John. Nice holiday?,I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
Son?,Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
Is he on his own?,Just carrying a bag.
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.,I got the money to pay for 'em.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.,What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?,Er well, yes we do.
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.,What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?,I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
Right, his leg's going now.,All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.,Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Well, what do you want us to do about it?,Hit the fuckers.
There's nothing in it!,What do you mean?
Tom?,I'll only be a minute.
You got it all?,A hundred grand.
I think I would rather just turn them over.,I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
That's if I want to see you.,Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
And?,Do you want me to draw a picture?
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.,I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.,I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
How much did you say it was, Tom?,You know how much it is, Nick.
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.,Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
Look. Go on, look.,At what, exactly?
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.,Tom, you're all heart.
Where did you get those from, a museum?,Nick the Greek.
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?,I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
How many wings have they got between them?,Twelve.
How many feet?,Er, well, twelve.
You jerk--,I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.,I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.,I am, sir.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?,Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Who's "they"?,The--the officers.
Do whatever they tell you--,I mean, follow orders, sir.
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?,They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?,No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
Why don't you start with that?,Yes, sir.
You're dismissed.,Thank you, Sergeant Major.
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.,Yes, Sergeant.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.,Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
Nice job.,Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
You know the popular version of how he left town.,Everybody on the border knows that story.
You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?,Colt Peacemaker.
What's that for?,Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.,There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
Whole different story; isn't it?,You're fired. You're outta the department.
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--,That's in Maverick County.
350 pounds.,What?
Hey, it's the General.,Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Uncle Al--,Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
I'm a colonel.,Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--,The Trail of Tears.
Same as they done in Mexico.,But they were Indians themselves.
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?,No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
PDA?,Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
So how come you got into all this?,These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
So I'm part-Indian?,By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.,Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
Homework?,I finished that. I'm just messing around.
How's your room shaping up?,Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
Yeah. He lives here, right?,He does.
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.,You lived in the States for a while?
You finding lots of cactus and shit?,It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.,Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
Mikey--,If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
It's a .45.,Yeah?
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--,They were using M-1's, yeah--
He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--,He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
You spoil 'em, Cliff.,Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.,She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
Seriously.,Seriously, I think we should get married.
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--,I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
Treasure hunter?,Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
You get much of that in here?,It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.,We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.,That's right.
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.,I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
Reputation?,Bandidos, Injuns--
You have somebody else out there?,We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
"Mas cerveza por favor.",That Buddy was a cool breeze.
Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.,We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him.  He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.
Historic occasion, isn't it?,Seems like we have another one every week.
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.,We don't need a new jail.
That's a matter of interpretation--,We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--,We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
Never heard from him again?,Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.,Right.
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.,And I understand why you might want to think he could.
Charley Wade.,I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.,Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
There was a mandate in the last election--,It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
Steve called for you.,Steve?
How 'bout the Sheriff?,The Sheriff.
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.,If you spent a little more time training them--
Right. When he was killed.,A little older than Paloma is now.
There must have been somebody.,I was too busy.
He had the club out on the old trail road--,We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
People didn't complain?,Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.,And that was the last time you saw him?
What about it?,What was your deal with him?
What's she singing about?,What do you think?
Morning, Sheriff.,Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Three months.,You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--,So I've heard--
You built our patio while you  were on the county?,Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--,Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
So why did you come back here, Sam?,Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
You don't want to be Sheriff.,I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--,Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--,Pilar--
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?,She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.,Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--,The shooter local?
The Republicans?,No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--,They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
Yeah.,You'd do a good job.
You think we need a new jail?,Well, it's a complicated issue--
Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.,You don't need to cuff me.
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--,Just doing my job.
You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--,You telling me what to do, Roderick?
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.,I haven't seen anybody come by.
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.,You sell much out here?
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.,Another woman?
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.,You know who it was?
Otis what?,Payne.
He doesn't need to know all my business.,He's gonna find out.
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.,You believe that?
I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.,They go together.
I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.,Who?
You ever been married?,Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --,Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
Thanks, Billy.,Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
How'd you spell that again?,D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
D'Amour.,Right.
Who did this?,I told you --
Who did this?,All right.  It was...
D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?,I know him.  I saw him.
Please.,I could scoop them out.
And are you afraid?,Yes.
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.,Did your husband know Quaid?
He's a secretive man.,And you don't ask questions?
You don't believe me.,He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...,I don't know where you'd start.
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?,They won't tell you anything.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-,You didn't marry him for love.
So why did you marry him?,That's my business. Harry.
Okay.  I'll keep digging.,Yes.  You do that.
Oh Christ.,Why don't you tell me the truth?
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?,It was more than that, I think.
Stuff?,He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
What then?,I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
It's okay.,No it isn't.  You can't help me.
Are you sure?,I'm sure.  He's dead.
What was that?,It's okay.
I've got to help him.,You can't.
Oh God.,I just saw him.
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.,Maybe I just bought it.
Are you satisfied now?,No.
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?,Yes.
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann,I tried to pay you off.
You know Vinovich?,Sure.  Vivovich.
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.,I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
I only wear ties for funerals.,You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.,Have you been in?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...,Is that all?
Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.,And he didn't have them?
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.,Is that all?
Did she know where Nix was buried?,No.
He did something with the ground.,Yes?
Can you do it?,I don't know.
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.,No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?,I got to go.  I'm late.
Have we met before?,No.
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,,Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Maybe... I... don't...,What about Philip Swann?
And?,I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
You could still help me do that.,Why would I want to?
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.,Yes.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.,Yes.
Hello?,Bob, it's me.
Oh, hi, Elaine.,So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
What about you? Why are you here?,My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.,Oh.
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?,Ok.
Hello?,It's Charlotte.
Charlotte, who?,Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?,No, I was looking at you.
I know.,John thinks I'm so snotty.
Nice one.,Fuck off.
You think so?,Yeah, look at that thing.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.,I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Charlotte?,Hi, Bob.
Well... have a good flight.,Thanks.
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...,That sounds great  can you hold on...  What Zoe?
Yeah, its really different here.,Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.,What?
Not all that pasta.,Fine.
Hello?,Hello, Bob, it's me.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?,Fine. Is it going ok?
I guess she's busy.,That's ok.
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.,Bye.
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.,Why do you have to defend her?
Its bad for you.,Ok, I will... later.
It's amazing  there!,Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
Uh..thanks.,Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
I missed you.,Do you think they have a room here?
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.,No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
I found them in your file box.,Must be a spare set.
What a...jerk!,Peter, are you okay?
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.,What time did you make it for?
Quiet.  Real quiet...,And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.,Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?,Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
It's the patient's request, doctor.,I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before.  Satan is not what you think he is.  Satan is not some creature.,You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.,You ready?
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.,Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.,Just open the door, please.
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.,Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
What do you mean "don't worry?",Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.,How many weeks are you honey/
Two negatives always make a positive.,Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
May I help you?,Peter Kelson?
And also that...,Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?,Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
What's that got to do with you?,Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
I'll bet.,On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.,Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
You should think about getting professional help.,You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
I don't understand what's going on.,There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
So what?,Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.,So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
There's nothing else here.,What's the bible for?
You have to say that.,That's true.
Plenty of time.,What are these?
Hello?,I know who he is.
He can see you Thursday.,I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
Good of you to stop by.,We millionaires yet?
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.,Thanks for having me, Sally.
What's this?,So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
Thanks for handling this.,Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
What happened?,Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
I hate it.,Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
nothing.,I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.,Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
Hi.,Need any help?
Engaged.,To that stewardess?
That's not it.,Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
What are you talking about?,When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
Okay.,Thanks, sweetheart.
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?,Are you okay?
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.,You're a caterer?
Can I take your coat?,You're cold?
I'm an English major.  You like English?,Sort of.
Wait...,Shh.  It's okay.
So how long is this trip?,Four days.
A horse?,Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
That too tight?,No.
Mom's going to hate it.,Always on my ass, anyway.
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?,Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
And he's fine, girl.,How'd you get him to say yes?
I don't know how to walk in heels.,Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
You ever been in love?,Too many times.
They ever love you back?,Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.,The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
Hey, munchkin.,Dad.  What are you doing here?
But?,No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
Thanks.,But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
I know.,Just one word of advice for next season.
What's that?,Never let a freshman take your spot.
Well, what do you know.,What's up, Sidra.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.,How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
So...does it hurt?,It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
You do act different.,I don't care.
I think we gotta kiss now.,For how long?
I want to ride my own bike.,My Dad always drives my Mom.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.,Guess "please" would be a stretch.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?,Who's Spalding?
That's it, give it your best shot.,Would you watch the damn road?
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.,I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
Didn't know you cared so much.,I don't.
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.,That what you think?
When'd you get this?,It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
It's okay, little baby.,Quit.
Then prove her wrong.,I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
So how about a little one-on-one?,What are we playing for?
Give me the ball.,My court, I go first.
I...can't.,Why not?
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.,I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
I've been trying to find you all day.,Here I am.
Sorry about your game.,It happens, right...
Who was that?,Nobody.
Hey.,Hey, what's up.
You forgot to be there.,That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
Stay!,If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
Never had to.,I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.,I'm not asking for us to be together.
So that's it, just forget about us?,Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.,I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.,Yup.
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.,Not for Quincy McCall.
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?,We won the championship.
Funny.  I never did.,Kiss my ass.
Actually, I don't...,What do you mean?
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?,No.
Who's this guy I always see her around?,Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
It just isn't.,Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
You're serious.,Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
Like what?,Maybe go back to school.
So why'd you give up ball?,Why do you keep asking me that?
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?,I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.,Then why are you so upset?
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.,Better late than never, right?
Zeke.,What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
With who?,Business folks.
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.,What are you doing in my room?
Still the man.,Yup.
You scared me.,Sorry.  You okay?
You don't wanna hurt your back.,Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.,What mess?
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.,Tell me what?
I just told you.,I mean, it's not true, is it?
So what are you gonna do?,I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
I ain't a damn liar.,Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
What do you want?,Came by to check on you.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?,I don't know.
No need for braces, Donnie.,THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
Hello?,Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
Uh-huh.,Does this sound weird?
What kind of Cancer?,Brain and Lung.
Wanna call me a slut now, something?,No.  No.
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --,Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.,I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
Wilson.,Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.,Was it a boyfriend of yours?
You mind if I check things back here?,It's fine.
got some coffee brewing, huh?,Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --,-- do you wanna cup?
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --,Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --,It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --,If you're not here for a 422 --
No.,Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
Billingsley's?,Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
It's my favorite place --,Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
And I bet you say that to all the girls --,No, no.
You really use strong language.,I'm sorry --
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --,I'm sorry.
Well.,That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
Yeah.,Can I tell you something?
Yeah, of course.,I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
Just say no.,I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
You live alone?,Yes.
What's your name?,Claudia.
Hello.  You're back again, huh?,yeah, yes, hi, hello.
-- what kind?,It doesn't matter.
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.,Ready to go,go,go?
Where's the news department at this studio?,It's upstairs.
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?,I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
Can you hold it?,I don't know.
I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.,Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
Let's go, c'mon, get up --,Did we win or lose, I mean --?

You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --,Might of been before my time.
I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....,Mmm.Hmm.
This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.,Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --,FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
And how much is braces?,It's...doesn't matter....
Give me your keys, Don.,PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
He has Phil right now.,Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --,We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.,Do you wanna sit down?
I need to sit down.,Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
...no...no goddamn use.  I have a son, y'know?,You do?
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...,When was the last time you talked to your son?
Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?,Yeah.
...cocksucker....,How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
...I can't hold onto this anymore...,I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
...gimme that fuckin' phone...,Who are you gonna call?
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?,Who?
Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?,No.
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.,Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
I'm confused about your past is the thing.,Is that still lingering?
I would just want to clear some things up:,Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --,In aid of what?
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --,This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --,I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
Do you remember a Miss Simms?,I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --,-- fuck you.
Why does that sound silly?,Well I guess it doesn't.
And your father?,He passed away.
And "Frank?","Frank" was my mother's father.
I've heard your tapes on the phone.,Oh yeah.
I am calm.,I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
You're here.,OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.,It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?,No.
This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --,THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --,THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.,It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
I don't think I want that.,It'll take the pain away.
How do we do this, then?,We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
No.  No.,No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --,--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?,Yeah.
Who?,Rose, I don't --
Two years...three years...,What about now?
I don't.,Do you feel better now that you've said this?
I love you so much.,I'm not through asking my questions.
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...,Did you ever touch her?
Want me to wake her up?,I'II go....is it...back here?
I'm sorry.,It's alright.
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.,You need to sober up.
Linda --,What are you doing?
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?,mmmhmm.
Pink Dot.,Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
Bottled Water?,Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
Ok.,And um....do you have Swank magazine?
Yeah.,Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
yeah, I said.  Is that it?,That's it.
The fuck is wrong with you?,I gotta go to the bathroom.
Let's go,let's go, let's go, you shoulda done that ten minutes ago --,We need more dog food --
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?,I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.
Be ready at two --,Should be one-thirty.
You coulda been in front --,-- I didn't see you from the window.
What's the problem, what's the problem here?,I'm fine. nothing.
..sorry...,It's ok.
What is that?,It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...,If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
D'Artagnan, arrest them all!,Shut up, knave!
It can.  I know the way.,I am with you!
What are they doing?,Making the key to the throne.
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?,Soon enough.  Here we are.
Who is he, Aramis?,Tomorrow.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!,There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!,Yes, and he has a choice!
More wine!!,You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
Aramis, this will never --,Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
Bloody hell...,We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.,The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.,They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?,I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
Mother of God!,It is also a place of burial.
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!,Come on...
He's going to kill you, Aramis.,Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.,Who?
D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.,He is right, d'Artagnan.
What do we do now?,I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
Do I look all right?,None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.,It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.,What is its antidote?
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.,I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?,How did you know -- ?
Phillippe...?,How did you --
Are you hungry?,Just... water.
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.,Phillippe.  Rest now.
I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.,Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
Betrothed?  I think not.,In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!,Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!,At least help Raoul.
I was told this impostor was dead!,... You knew you had a double?
Where is Michelle?,There.
You've... memorized...?,What was the end page?
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?,Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!,The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?,Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Exactly why it should be given away.,What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.,Raoul... is in love...
This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.,I... we are humble people...
It's Marvosa -,What do you need?
We're by Ozone...,You set to go -
What do you think?,Alright, stay on the phone.
You can cut the shit, asshole--,we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...,It wasn't in the cards.
Zydowski.  It's about time.,You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.,Who is it?
No...,You're the mysterious type, right?
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.,What happened with the tape?
Tubbs, it's me.,Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -,They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!,I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.,Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
I've got a better idea...,OK...where do you want to start?
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.,How about Marvosa and the others?
Tubbs, these people mean business.,I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
Are you going to be alright?,Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
Where are you going?,Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
You must be going somewhere.,I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.,Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!,Did you have sex with her?
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.,That was Peterson upstairs.
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.,Why aren't you ever alone with him?
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.,If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.,How are Molly and the boy?
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.,Right.  What about sweating Lecktor?
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?,Not the Bible?
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.',That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?,No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.,I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.,Somebody hurt him?
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...,I know...
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.,You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.,We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.,Why?
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.,After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?,Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.,It's your call, Will. What do we do?
Who is it?,Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
You got the message Lecktor called...,I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
When are you coming back?,When I'm done.
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.,'Changes?'
It's not over yet.,It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.  The full moon is tonight.
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?,He had to.
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.,How far away's the back-up?
When do you need it?,In eight days.
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?,It'll do fine.
You worked out well.,You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
I'll probably go back to it someday.,Uh-huh.
Is that you. D?,Yes, are you okay...?!
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?,I'm fine, Francis.
I'll see you later. All right?,You'll come by?
Who is it?,It's me.
Who?,Me.
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!,No!
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...,Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.,My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
What am I doing here?,Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
Do you feel privileged?,I'm very scared.
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?,I don't know...
Are you a man?,Yes.
Do you imply that I'm a queer?,God, no.
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.,'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.,You'll let me go now?
The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?,No.
Can you read it to me?,It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
Okay.,We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?,Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.,He only bit women so far, right?
The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?,Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
What happened to them?,One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
To yourself...,I call him a monster.
I understand he cut you pretty good...,What about the dog?
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.,I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
To do what?,I have to see somebody.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.,Blue, then.
Blue is cold.,Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
Have you ever omitted telling me. things before?,No.
Yes. Is Molly there?,My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
I know... 'Out in the good air...',What's that?
That's right.,There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Lt. Fisk said...,Go on to the house...
Yes. Who are you?,My name's Will Graham. I...
Will it keep them out?,Yeah...
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?,Yes.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.,I keep getting it for Christmas.
Did you get my card?,I got it. Thank you.
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?,No.
And?,Very interesting, even to a layman.
Yes.,You read about it, I'm sure.
Why should I tell you?,There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
Why does it feel good?,It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?,Pretty well.
Glaser Safety Slugs?,...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times',You got it.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?,No.  Caspiar.
People love... comedians.,I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!,The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?,Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!,But George, I like to push the boundaries...
Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.,There'll be other shots.
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!",But wasn't it funny?
They're having a laugh...,WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
You must take a little pleasure in it.,Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.,So who's gonna pay for it?
I can't move my arm.,You've got good days and bad days.
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!,Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
Five.,Twenty!
Right...,Okay, great!  So let's reset!
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.,Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.,Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.,I'm here, ain't I?
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??,I can shtop whenever I want...
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.,I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.,I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
Have you told your family?,No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --,You're a wimp.
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --,You're a wimp.
I'm gonna quit.,What?!?
Sir, do you have a problem?,Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
I, I was asked to do this material - -,Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
I was very original!,Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
Goals are important.,I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.,Are you sure?
"Burlesque"?,Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
Get off my stage!  You're fired!,I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
Can I help you with something?,Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.,Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
Sure...,What's your name?
They are dead.  In either case --,We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
You don't know.,Know what?
Who is it?,It's Choi.
You're two hours late.,I know.  It's her fault.
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?,All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
Don't be ridiculous.,We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.,Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
Hello, Trinity.,Cypher?  Where's Tank?
... yes.,No!
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!,He's going to pop!
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.,Really?
Thanks... for the drink.,Any time.
Yes.,Goddamnit!
You can't use that until Neo is out!,I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
The cubicle across from you is empty.,But what if...?
Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.,It's an honor.
I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?,You could say that.
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?,You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
Why not?,Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.,What truth?
The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.,What does that mean?
... am I dead?,Far from it.
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?,More important than what is when?
When?,You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
Right now, we're inside a computer program?,Wild, isn't it?
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?,No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
She helped you?,Yes.
What did she tell you?,That I would find the One.
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.,Why?
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.,That's why we're here.
Got it.,I need the main wet-wall.
Tank.,Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
How...?!,He is the One.  He is the One!
That vase.,Shit, I'm sorry.
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.,I'm not the One.
I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.,Who are you?
How did you do that?,Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.,What is the Matrix?
What the hell is this?!,It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
What is this thing?,We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
You can't!,I have to.
No one has ever done anything like this.,Yeah?
Can you fly that thing.,Not yet.
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.,What do they want?
Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.,I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
Which way?  Which way?,Duck!
There is.  We have to pull the plug.,You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Neo!,What the hell just happened?
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.,Thanks.
What are your plans?,Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?,Look fella...this is private...
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...,Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
Yeah.,And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Yeah.,Ok.  Wait here.
Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.,Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
'Art thou the King of the Jews'?,'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.','Thou art then a king?'
Who's the girl?,Jewish...
Look at her.,She don't look Jewish.
Where to?,Kennedy.
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?,It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
Drinks for everybody Tony...,Giovanino!  Where have you been?
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.,Don't worry.  I can handle it.
You couldn't handle shit.  You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand?  Hold onto your pay- check this week.,There won't be any this week.
What do you mean?,Didn't show up.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?,I don't like loading crates.
Let's get out of here.,Did you see them run!
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.,That's not going to help.
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!,I understand.
Keep your mouth shut.,You tell me that in front of these creeps?
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???,No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
Don't you move!!!,I'll be here.  Don't worry.
Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...,He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
What are you going to do?  Hide me?,Good idea.
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?,What pipes?
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.,Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
No...I'll be ok for a week.,You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Out!!!!,C'mon Johnny.
You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.,How much was the original loan again?
Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?,Whatever.
Diane, how are you feeling?,Fine.
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...,Fine.
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?,Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.,You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
No, she's got epilepsy.,Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?,What do they expect you to say?
Well, maybe you missed something?,Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
Wasn't a book...was a short story.,What was it?
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.,Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?,Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.,Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Maybe, who knows.,Charlie...?
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...,What is it now?
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?,Did you?
See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?,Sure...He lives there?
I'm sleepy.,You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.,Yeah, so things'll be even.
Hey... you got stereo.,Yeah, I think so.
You mean it's heisted.,You could say that.
Can you spare it?,Sure.
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.,Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
-- But he does seem very nice.,You think so?
Did you speak to the Governor?,He's coming.
Daddy!,Hi, Allison --
Have you got a minute?,Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...,Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.,Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
-- Black.,Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?,Who?
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.,I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
Who's Annie?,From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
I don't like cake.,It's for the party, Dad --
What about the Mayor?,He said he would be there with bells on.
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.,Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?,I'm sorry, I don't recall --
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --,I thought you were buying my company.
I would prefer some peanut butter.,How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
Well... goodnight.,Yeah.  Goodnight.
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.,That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
Thank you for coming.,Hello, Quince.
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --,Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
May I interrupting?,Yes.
No, I don't --,Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.,-- And now you're going to pee some more.
'Yes'.,'Yes' to the deal?
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --,No no, not you.
It's going to be great --,Do you think I need a haircut?
Have we met?,Uh -- he's from out of town --
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.,As much as Joe's?
The answer is no, quick enough for you?,Don't you want to hear the details?
I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.,Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
Obeah.,Obeah evil.  I not evil.
Doctor lady make it irey.,Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Can't, sistah.,Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
Don' need you okayin'.,Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.,Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?,Sure.
Jennifer.,Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
That's very gracious of you, Quince.,No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.,What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
What are you doing here?,I'm lost.
'Big'?,You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
-- What kind of childhood did you have?,Do you love Drew?
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.,I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
Very well, I'll watch.,Watch me do what?
Whatever you do.,That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --,Be sorry for nothing.
I wanted to apologize, Susan --,I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
I appreciate you --,Excuse me?
Has her pain abated?,We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
Where are you going?,To bed.
I love your smell.,-- I guess you haven't.
Did you like making love to me?,I loved it.
Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.,Where are you going?
Will it?,Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
Did I say that?,And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
I'm still here.,But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --,I love you now, I'll love you always --
That's it?,Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.,'Threw' you?  Where?
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.,Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?,Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
And what?,And I won't tell anyone who you are.
Sounds fair enough.,It is a deal?
A 'deal'?,You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.
What's it like where I'm going?,Can you keep a secret?
Yes.,So can I.
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.,I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
...I'd like to be alone for a while.,Are you sad, Bill?
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.,No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
And more.,Why didn't you stop me?
Why did you go to the hospital?,I don't know.
Hello, Bill.,Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.,Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
You're violating the laws of the universe.,This universe?
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.,What are you saying, that it's time to go?
You are?,Yeah.
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.,How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
So that's what love is?,Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
No.,Does she know where she's going?
He is --,I'll take it from here --  I am --
Happy Birthday, Bill.,Thank you.
Yes.,Death!
It just occurred to me --,Speak up, please.
'Yes' what?,'Yes' is the answer to your question.
I think you know --,I don't!
Where are you?,I'm here.
'The one' to do what?,Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
What the hell are you talking about?,Watch it!
The 'question' --,Yes, Bill.  The question.
I am, this is it.  B Day.,How's that, Quince?
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.,No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?,Yeah, I give a shit.
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --,It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?,Yes, I believe I do.
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.,You think Drew will go for it?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.,Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --,No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --,How did you know?
Drew told me.,Does Drew tell you everything?
I don't like to interfere.,...Then don't.
Not my birthday again?,You're only six-five once.
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?,Probably.
Don't get carried away.,Uh oh --
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.,That's all?
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.,'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
Aw, you're tough.,I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.,You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
Daddy, what's the matter?,Nothing.  I'm sorry.
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?,Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
That was wonderful.,Yeah, it's good to get together.
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.,Where's he going?
I don't know, I can't say --,C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
But what?,I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.,Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.,Why not?
...We know so little about each other.,But we've got time.
78.,I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 85.,I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
47.,I think I know her.
66.,Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
Shit. Wrong room.,What?
No, let's go.,Then why is this my handwriting?
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.,Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.,Hi, Leonard.
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.,A cop?
What?,Who did this to you?
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *,Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?
Why?,I don't want blood on them.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *,Tell me about her again.
Why?,Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
They treating you alright?,Don't remember.
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.,That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
Your wife?,She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
Who?,Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
I'm not.,Help me.
What?,Kill him. I'll pay you.
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.,What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
Calm down.,That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
Don't say another fucking word!,About your whore of a wife?
My wife.,Sweet.
Dying.,What?
You're the memory guy?,How do you know about me?
My boyfriend told me about you.,Who's your boyfriend?
My name's Leonard.							 *,Did Teddy send you?
I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.,So why did you come here?
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -,Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!,Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
Shut your mouth!,Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
You're living.,Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
You don't know him?,No! Should I?
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.,How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
Prove it.,Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.,Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
Happy now?,I won't be happy until you leave town.
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -,That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
How'd you know I was in here?,The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
How do you know this?,'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
How do you know him?,I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
This is a drug deal?!,That, and your thing.						   *
He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?							  *,You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
It is now.,You can't just take it!
Sal Maguda.,He any good?
With Sonny.  110%.,Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.
Sure.,I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
So...?,Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.,Okay.  You got the "item"?
I got the item.,And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.,Really?  So, what is this, a party?
We want it back.,Okay.
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...,You do business in Cuba with your husband?
Available cash is not an issue for us...,Twenty-eight-point-five.
Is this the protective male talk?,This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?,No.
You afraid of violence?,I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
I do.  We don't do business with him...,He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?,Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
So?,We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.,What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
What do we got?,Five minutes...
Like...?,Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
Where?,Verdado.
Verdado where?,It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
Havana, Cuba...?,No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.,And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?",You think I am in so deep I forgot?
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.,Okay.  What's up?
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?,NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
Never heard of him.,From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
Out of...?,Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny.",Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?
Yeah.,Where's Riccardo?
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...,Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
They had me from the gate.,I don't understand...
Where are you?,...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?,They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...,He did volunteer one time...
You mean with the flowers...?,What's it say?
...the lease, the phones, the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks.  How long did it take them?  Three hours? Four?  This means, "We can reach out and touch somebody."  Like Bad Teleflora.,...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.,Not French registry?
Why?,A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.,Define small.
What do you care?,Do we need this...?
This the load you lost a while back?,It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
I gotta, I gotta go...!,Alonzo...
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if...,They lied.
Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty...,You're hoping to get a look at what?
You ain't coming to work?,Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?,Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?,I ain't sleepy.
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.,What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.,Talking helps. Don't talk, you get muddled in your head. Hey! Now you just look at this here!
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!,Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
For money.,For money for what?
What's in your socks?,Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
You don't seem like no fag...,What's that supposed to mean?
What for?,So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.,Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.,Can he smell the difference, eh?
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.,He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
Tell her, Ratso.,Twenty bucks...
Well, if you're awright, why you hanging on the bannister. Can you walk or not?,Walk? Naturally I can walk.
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?,I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.,I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
These guys're good drivers.,They gotta be.
Sounds like they knew you.,Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico?
Thanks, Joe.,Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?
What you got me up here for?,Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?,No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.,Yessir, I can see that.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?,Uh, yessir.
Ready for hard work, son?,Ready for anything.
Sold. Let's go.,... and taxi fare for me.
Two kilos.,Where?
Twenty months?,Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
It's there!,What?
What?,How's your hernia?
Anybody bitten?,Nah, just covered with batshit!
To what?,The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
Too bad you didn't have a machine.,There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.,Stop shitting me, man!
Where you staying, Dad?,The Hilton.
DAD!,Oh Jesus! 
You know where they are?,Sure.
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?,Not far. Just a little way.
No, I'm not afraid.,Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.,Would you recognize him again?
...are you with the Consulate?,Something like that. Cigarette?
She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to.,Lucky girl.
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.,Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
What they give you?,Twelve years.
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.,He wasn't even in the car?
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!,It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
We go back.,What?  You gotta be joking.
Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me.  That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight.,Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
What?,After we're outside the kogus?
What?,Cut his fucking throat.
Hishradyo.,Max - where?
Just got some news on Bell.,What?
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.,Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
Know what?,Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. ,If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.,New York's finest.
Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.,What?
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?,Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.,No, you talkin' at me.
Did you see the size of that thing?!,Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
Wait a minute-,Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
Its muscles are locked.,Oh, Jesus!!
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...,Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.,How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
What are you putting that crap on me for?,Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
He didn't do it!,What?
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...,"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.,Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!,Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.,We?
Metaxonycha Godmani.,So?
You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?,I heard how you talked to him.
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.,Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...,It didn't bite me.
Talk to me.,Peter...
That's impossible.  Insects don't...,I know.  Help me get a sample.
Oh, my!,Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
What do you want to know?,Anything you can tell me might help.
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.,I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.,Following me?
You're very kind...,And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.,You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
What's your new book called?,I don't have a title yet.
The profanity bothers you?,It has no nobility.
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...,My daughter must be going nuts.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.,I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.,Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.,I'm getting to believe you.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.,I know how that can be.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?,Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
Then who did?,No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
Then light the match, Paul.,No big deal.
See, isn't this nice?,Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?,Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.,You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.,C'mere, I'll show you.
Here, in case you think of any ideas.,Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
You can--you have the "gotta"--,The what?
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?,Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?,It's perfect.
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.,Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
Paul, I know you've been out.,What?
Don't talk to me like that.,Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.,Three more chapters to go.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?,Maybe.
Yes, Paul.,I'm almost done.
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?,Just from his agent.
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.,It's good you found it.
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.,So do I...
Answer me a couple things?,If I can.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.,Great.
How I usually find you, Nyah.,How do you that.
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.,Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
You won.,I suppose I did.
To win?,What else?
God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?,If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money.,What are you talking about?
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.,You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.,I knew where it was.
What was the top bid?,Why, you going to make me a better offer?
She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.,She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..,Ninety-three point four million.
Well do you disagree with that?,Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
Before we kill her or cure her..,Right.
We're due to take off.,Not for seven more minutes.
There she is.  I got visual.,We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.,He's heading down the stairs, now..
No.  You just looked as if you did.,No.  Just as if I'd like to.
- right..where is it?,Far right.
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?,Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..,Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.,Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..,So do I.  Sort of.
Ask a question, you get an answer!..,Damn, you're beautiful.
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.,I'd like a little more conviction..
You don't trust me.,Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.,Yes?
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.,Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?,Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?,Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.,Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
An idea, yeah.,Like?
Right now only Ambrose knows that.,In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
And then what?,Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.,Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?,You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.,Yes, I gathered as much.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.,Yes.
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.,You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
It's the transponder.,Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.,You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
Let's start from the inside out.,All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.,I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!,So what do you suggest?
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!,Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
What kind of show.,I dont know.  It didnt say on the tickets.
You knew about Jim?,Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
Dont Jim.,Now we dont have to eliminate him?  You like that, dont you Claire?  Dont you?
They're dead.  Jim's dead.,Take off your coat.
What are you going to do?,I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.,You don't think we're going to make it.
Kittridge...,Bastard!
What happened?,I sent the message to Max.  Were on for tomorrow.
Two cars.  Where are you?,You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
Claire.,Its all right, Ethan..youll bring me back...wont you...
Whos dead?,My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- dont know
Are you damaged?,They knew we were coming.  Golitsyns dead too.  The disk is gone.
I dont think so.,Dont <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?,Yeah.  I follow you.
We've lost enough agents for one night.,You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
What?,Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.,This whole operation was a molehunt.
May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.,Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- <u>with</u> the artificial intelligence Risk chip --
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.,Now I want you to hold onto it.
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.,Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?,About what?
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.,Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?,Why don't you come back with me?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.,You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.,Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
Very good.,Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
What was your deal with Job?,Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
How will you make sure Job will be there?,How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.,I wouldn't dream of it.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.,What about Job?
What sector's the air conditioning?,Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!,Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.,Let's move!
Jack.  Jack.,I didn't touch it.
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.,What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
Would you remove your hat please?,Why?
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.,If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
Forty-four.  Forty-five.,I'd say you've got about two minutes.
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.,A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
How was Chicago?,Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.,You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
Whats going to make him do that?,What he didnt get in Prague.  The NOC list.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?,Of course I can hear you.
Why don't you take a look?,Jack...that's spying.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.,That's not so good for you, my friend.
The Shawfish?,Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
Very good, Mr. Johnny.,We will both have the Salad Ticino.
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.,I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
In a month.,I won't come.
Here.,It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
I got it done.,What are you doing here?
Why you looking around so much?,I don't know. I got a feeling.
Have you come from my brother?,Yes.
Why?,I'm going to marry him.
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fianc saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.,That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
This is good. Uhh...,Loretta.
How'd he die?,Bus hit him.
Fast.,Instantaneous.
Why?,Why what?
How many men since then?,Just Johnny.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.,What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
Why you talking to me?,You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!,Because I have no Luck!
To the bed.,Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
I can't believe what is happening.,Me neither.
You don't get along with anybody!,What did you do?
What did I do?,You ruined my life.
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!,Oh no I didn't!
Snap out of it!,I can't!
But that's cause he don't know!,Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
What are you talking about?,I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Hi.,Hi.
It's really cold.,Yeah. It smells like snow.
I'm here!,You're late!
I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?,Yeah.
I'm freezing to death.,Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?,Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?,You? No.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.,Maybe you're right.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.,She was too young for him.
You never have dessert.,Never is a long time.
What's the matter?,My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.,I don't understand.
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.,Alright.
How near is she to death?,A week. Two weeks. No more.
I have no secrets from my family.,Loretta, I can't marry you.
No.,Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
Will you live here?,No.
What! How do you know?,A wife knows.
WHAT!! She was dying!,It was a miracle.
Do you love him, Loretta?,Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
What about the moon?,Did you see it?
Hi, Loretta.,Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
We just come from the bank.,The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
I know.,Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
Don't fight.,My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.,She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
My mother's recovered.,You're kidding?
No idea.,Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Have you come to make peace with me?,Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
I'm sure she did.,It was a miracle!
Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?,Absolutely!
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.,I'm not disturbed. By you.
My lady friend has a personality disorder.,She was just too young for you.
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?,None of your business.
Sorry. That was rude.,Will you join me for dinner?
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.,I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
You knew that man?,Yes.
Rita. Rita.,What? What?
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.,Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fianc's in Palermo.,Oh. Right.
Burn them.,And what do you burn, apart from witches?
I see.  Yes, of course.,So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?,Not at all.  They could be carried.
Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?,Please!
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...,He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.,But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?,How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
King of the WHO?,The Britons.
Who are the Britons?,All of us are ... we are all Britons.
Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...,NI!
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...,You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
What, "is"?,No, no ... not "is"!
None shall pass.,What?
None shall pass.,I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
Now stand aside worthy adversary.,'Tis but a scratch.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.,No, it isn't.
Well ... can we come up and have a look?,Of course not!  You are English pigs.
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?,I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?,My liege,  I am honored.
Who ... Who breaks out?,Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
We shall attack at once.,Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
Who are they?,Oh, just some friends!
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!,Greetings King Arthur.
What?,A G...g...g...
Where?,There.
... You silly sod.,What?
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?,I'm thirty-seven.
... but a two-thirds majority ...,Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!,Shut up!
The nose?,And the hat.  But she is a witch.
Who approaches the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see.,Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
What is your name?,My name is Sir Launcelot.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.,What is your name?
'Ere.  He says he's not dead.,Yes he is.
Don't be such a baby.,I can't take him.
Well taken, Concorde!,Thank you, sir, most kind ...
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!,I think I could pull through, sir.
Did you kill all those guards?,Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
You killed eight wedding guests in all!,Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...,Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.,But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
But, Father.,Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!,I was saved at the last minute.
How?,Well ... I'll tell you ...
We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.,Leaving the room.
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?,No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.,No ... just keep him in here.
And make sure he doesn't leave.,What?
Where are you going?,We're coming with you.
Sir Galahad!,Oh ... hello ...
Quick!,Why?
Well, she's got a point.,We'll cover your escape!
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.,Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
They're all saying the word ...,Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!,That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.,Brave, Sir Rob ...
Not bad, not bad.,How about yourself?
Sixty.,That's pretty good for a ghillie.
What?,You know what I mean.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.,You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
She's got an army of people to get her up and out.,But I'm the only one she trusts.
And she sent no word down?,They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.,She'll be worried about me.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.,You know nothing about her!
It's what the maids are for.,I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her.,She needs me, Archie.  She canna do without me, she said it to my face.  How can I stop now?
Good man.  And is she all right?,Yeah.
No doubt you've heard the rumors.,I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.,I see.
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.,Out of my way!
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--,I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?,It is quite late enough.
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.,Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.,That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.
Checked and locked, sir.,Back and upper corridors.
I'm sorry?,How will I know what she requires?
Go inside at once.,Is that the Queen's request?
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.,I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.,I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.,I'm fine.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?,I said.  I serve the Queen.
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.,Why do you think I keep her here?
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.,She trusts you, John.
No loyalty.,No love.
And the pony?,She's well, too.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.,Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
What is it, John?  John?,I heard something.
John?,Yes, ma'am?
Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.,But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
Then they may read about me.,Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.,Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?,No, ma'am.
This is my good John Brown.,Yes.
Well, both.,The question is, do we need her?
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?,Who?
What's her excuse this time?,The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.,No, she wasn't.
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.,Dear oh dear.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.,Of course.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.,Whom?
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...,Why am I being lectured in this way?!
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.,The same, your Majesty.
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.,What is he doing there?
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.,I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
Well?,Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
Why?,I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
How long has he been this sick?,A few days, ma'am.
Please make sure it does not happen again.,Of course, at once.
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.,Why?
Why not?,I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
I have a letter, ma'am.,From whom?
What do they want?,They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.  But you are not eating enough.  One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.,Yes, ma'am.
Where is my son?,Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Then why are you not with him?,You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
What is the matter with him?,He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
What do you mean?,It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are...  Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  If you're too late, The Screamer comes.,How do you stop The Screamer?
Could you play ARCADE with that?,Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...,Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.,And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
Nick, Alex, how are we today?,How'd you know it was us?
Sick?,Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...,But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.,What the hell are you talking about?
Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.,Funny.
Happy?,No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.,Like the fractals?
SLIP-STREAM.,What?
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.,I was afraid you'd say that.
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?,What are you going to do?
You got the schematics?,Everything.
Alex...,You didn't hear me?
What are you looking for?,A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.,Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.,Got it.
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.,And then keep on driving?
It's here!!!,Oh God...oh god...
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?,Not yet, honey...
A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.,That's impossible.
"Escape"?,In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...,The Air-Force is working on the same thing.
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.,I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
Adam, where are you?,What's going on, Cynthia?
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!,No.
And?,You're broke!
But I'm not broke.,I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.,Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
It will work out.,Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
I understand.,You're an understandin' fella.
So, what did they say?,Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.,Yes, he is. He raises corn.
No, I don't.,That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
It's unbelievable!,I told ya.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.,You got it! See you later honey.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.,It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing,Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
My name is Rita.,Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
Can you tell me what happened?,No. I can't.
What is it Rita?,I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
What do you mean? You're Rita.,I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
The money. You don't know where it came from?,Unh, unh.
Okay.,Come on... let's find you something to wear.
"You're still here?","I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... ","What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. ,Good luck!
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.,Okay.
Yeah, what for?,Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
What's  the matter now?,Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?,I just wanted to come here.
It's kind of embarrassing but,,Go ahead.
You feel it?,Yeah.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?,No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
Palmdale.,Damn, that's a long drive.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.,Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
No...,You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
That's it folks for the Demon Boat Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.,Where's the dock ?
I'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.,Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.
Why should we trust you ?,I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?,We have to climb up that.
Come on, it works.,Give me a fucking.....
So where does this lead ?,No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
So what do we do ?,I'm working on it.
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?,NO ! I wouldn't do that.
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.,Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
I wanted to let his family know....,Know what ? That it was your fault ?
This is cute.,Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?,You don't. It's random, there no trick.
Just stop it. End it here.,It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.,That's a shame.
Are you Matthew Parker ?,Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.,Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !,I don't help criminals.
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? ,Because of my charming personality ?
What's next Walt ?,A dragon.
That's not to tough.,Look...
Where ?,In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.,Don't have to tell me twice.
Hand me the 3/8ths.,Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
When I think you're ready.,When will that be ?
Trust is earned not given away.,RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.,I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.,So ?
Parking tickets ? That's it ?,Yeah, but we're talking 43.
Well ?,Fire the whole division.
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?,Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.,Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.,That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.,What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.,Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.,I was.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?,What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
What was that ?,He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.,I'll see that bet.
Maybe you should get over fears.,Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !,I can see that but where ?
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?,The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.
Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.,I think I'll see hat action.
So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.,He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
What the ... ?,What happened ?
Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?,Excuse me, gentlemen
Really ? On a date ?,Yes.
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.,Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?,What the hell kind of cop are you ?
Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !,Shut up ! It's me.
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.,What ?
Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight.,Come to the rescue again I see.
He was right behind me !,Who was that guy anyway ?
No sir. I was just getting , well you know. Water. We weren't talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars. Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go now.,Why don't you shut up now.
Umm, where do you want this?,Oh, just put it over there.
People said she looked like me.,I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.,Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?,I would do it again in a minute.
Wow, you walked out with my mother?,You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
Visualize a spare?,Well you know what I mean.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.,Seriously?
There's still a big spot on the floor.,Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.,Was it a nice funeral?
I already bought a ticket.,What??
I'll be back in 137 hours.,Have fun.
Hi honey.,I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
What happened to Shelly?,She just had a baby that's all.
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.,If I eat it I'll throw up.
Well you should at least try a little bit.,Then I'll throw up a little bit.
Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.,Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.,You're being narrow-minded.
What're you saying?,Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Are you saying my mother had another husband?,Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
Sure am, who are you?,I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.,Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
I'd say you turned out just fine.,I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?,Well...
Hi.,Come on in!
What are you staring at?,It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
What's the matter?,He likes you.
Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??,No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
What can I do for you?,Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.
I guess you have.,I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
Thanks,Give it back Nicholas!
He said it was a gift.,Yeah, RIGHT.
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.,And you're gonna solve the mystery?
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.,Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
Getting off please.,Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?,What difference does it make?
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.,Oh my gosh, here it is!
Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.,I'd never do that.
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.,Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.,At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.,I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
Just come and get it...right here!,DON'T, come on!!!
Uh oh...,What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.,He's an undertaker.
Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.,Like what?
That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?,Nick?
What's it for?,For the mini-bike fund.
I don't think the color of the interior is....,Rose this not the place to be having this...
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?,Yes, it does.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.,You want me to come with?
Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.,Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
Then you'll be all set.,Sounds like you're very organized.
He was caressing.,Phil for God sake.
Hi!,Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.,You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
Bye Aunt Rose.,Bye Niece, Vada.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?,Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?,Yes, I do.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.,Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
They're enormous, I know.,Is there milk in them already?
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.,You're telling me.
Why not now?,What do you mean?
Let me hold him.,O.K.
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.,This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.,Good for you baby.
You're such a baby.,All right, here.
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.,Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
The boss is watching us...,I'm impressed.
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.,Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.,What Hurts Vada?
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.,Uhh, Miss devoto...
Excuse me, what about the job?,Pardon?
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.,You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.,Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
Well the other night at dinner...,Oh that, she just likes to play.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.,It's no big deal.
Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.,Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
Yeah.,Are you mad at me?
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.,Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Watch you don't knock out a fish.,Perfect.
Vada, we're trying to work here.,Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?,They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?,That's a lot of money for a little girl.
It's for school, for summer writing class.,Any more soda left?
I like the freak show.,I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
What are you doing.,Feeding my fish.
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.,I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!,Get away, get away!!
Do you miss her?,Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
Oh yes, oh that's great.,I'm very nervous.
No, no no....,Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.,Vada, this is an adult writing class.
Please.,Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.,You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
Does he love her?,Probably.
Do you like her?,Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Why?,After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
She's shy.,Oh.
Who's winning?,I am.
He won't give it to me.,Well you don't know that. Ask him.
Vada? VADA?? What happened??,My ball, I lost my ball.
Big Ringo fan.,Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?,Can I use your bathroom first?
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?,Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.,Hi.
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.,Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
Daddy??!?!?!,Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
It's okay sweetheart.,I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
Eeeeuuuww, gross.,They're just fun to read.
At what?,That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.,Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Your lip bleeding?,No.
What's wrong with your eyes?,A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
Hmmmm, interesting.,What?
Do you remember her?,No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
Heaven.,I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?,It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
Pacifist!,I am not.
Bed wetter!,I stopped that!
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.,Duck!
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!,You're right, let's knock it down.
Hi Vada.,Hi, wanna ride bikes?
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.,I wanna live with them too.
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.,Really?
Wow, was it a decoder ring?,You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
I do, she's real funny.,He likes her better than me.
You can come to my house for dinner?,No, I'm hiding out.
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.,Hi Vada, can you come out?
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.,But, I don't know how.
Like this?,Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Just do it.,Okay, okay.
You better not either.,Well, let's spit on it.
Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?,If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
Needs salt.,Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.,... weeks.
I've lost interest.,He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
You think...,Desperate.  To talk.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!,The man you love.
Neosporin?,Try less appropriate.
Ben Gay.,That was Thursday.
I give.,I can't even say it.
Two words.,Major.  Dish.
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.,Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.,Oh, you're more than okay.

Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...,I love him.
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.,... unless he has a hump.
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...,... look good on Kimberly.
I saw the show.,... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.,It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
Ex-cuse me?,I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...,Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.,I know Ben.
I think he's been fired.,It doesn't say th...
I thought Michael was picking me up.,I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?,Nobody has.  So far.
Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...,... Thomas, yeh.
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.,Endearingly absent-minded.
Waiter! Check, please!,She finds him "personable."
Where was that, Florence, huh?,Firenze.
You never eat when you're despondent.,I switched that around when you weren't looking.
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.,Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...

This thing means that much to y...,It means a lot.
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.,"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.,A bad combination.
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...,The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
Well.  How come she didn't...,BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
What's up?,Shhh.
Almost three.,That is so romantic.
Because I could come...,To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
And to m...,... and you knew about this.

Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches...,Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.,You're much more his type.
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.,Well, that just happened that time.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.,I won first prize.
I don't want to listen to her sing -,Don't feel that way, honey.
You have to what?,Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
Don't worry, I'll take care or it,You're so good.
What do you really want?,Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
You bet.,Okay. Thanks.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.,How is that?
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.,Whose word?
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.,Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
Have you talked to Triplette?,Who the hell is he?
Well, how about the shopping center?,Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Okay, then we'll see you there.,Okay.
What's he running for?,President.
Bastard,Stop it!
Hey!,It's the den mother.
You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey,How in the world did he get shot?
Yes, sir.,Can I help you?
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?,Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.,Suits me.
He is just wonderful.,I'1l get your bag.
What's this?,Replacement party.
You must really like him.,Well, he's really amazing.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...,I don't really know what you're talking about.
Parts.,Do you carry door handles?
The car broke down.,Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.,Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
I want to get the dog off my bed.,But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
Have your children been deaf since birth?,Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
Well, can you tell me why?,It just is.
How long have you been with them?,About three years.
And before?,Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
Hello.,Linnea?
Yes.,Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
I'd really like to see you.,Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
Well...How have you been?,Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
Hello.,Wow!
I knew when I first met you.,Oh.
Terrific!  Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?,That's unkind.
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.,Fifteen minutes?
They said go see the chaplain.,I'm sorry but I have to go.
Oh, no.,He's pretty well known down here.
What for?,You're real favorites of his.
Sorry I'm late.,You're not.
Where's Bill?,Sleeping.
Well, I really think he's got a chance.,You do?
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.,He ain't really new.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.,You serious?
Oh, why thank you.,May I see your costume?
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?,Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
What did you think then?,I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
Try to keep it to a minimum.,We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?,What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Who is we?,The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
How come you never talk?,She was born without a tongue.
You guys stay on your bellies.,Yes, sir.
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.,Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?,Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Was what worth it?,Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
Tell me about the purity.,It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?,Sure.
Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.,Got it.
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.,So, what now?
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.,I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
Yeah baby.,You made every day like kindergarten.
Only on a much grander scale.,They've hypnotized the nation.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.,They actually apologized.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.,Where do the air ducts lead?
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?,It's hard to say Capt'n.
How immediate is immediately?,Next week's episode.
You can't be serious?,I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.,Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
Roger?,Rockin'!
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.,Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Okay, boys, let's have it.,Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
How's it working, Scotty?,Perfecto!
They passed the 'edge' along to us.,How so?
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.,Is that her real name?
I see.,Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---,Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
Three.,I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
How 'bout that furniture plant?,Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
They done that too long in my family.,They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.,You in a big hurry, boy?
Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.,No. You got the wrong idea.
I said: Cut it out!,Don't start no trouble, boy!
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?,I'll smile when it's funny.
Yeah.,Where was that?
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.,I been sendin' her money.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.,Okay.
Looks like you're doin' a good job.,Thanks.
Don't say much, do you?,Guess I don't.
Guess so.,Have anything in mind?
Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.,Like hell they wouldn't.
Your folks live there?,No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
That's right.,Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.,What d'you expect?
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?,You don't think much of yourself, do you?
How about another beer?,No thanks.
They must work on the section gang.,That's right.
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.,Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.,You got a problem all right.
How come you stay 'round here?,Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
But I would like to see you again.,You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.,Why did you?
I'm just going in to do my shopping.,Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
How old is your boy?,Four.
Your boy.,Okay, I guess.
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?,Don't call them that.
What about him?,He could live with us.
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.,Come here, baby.
Hmmm - good coffee.,You didn't answer my question.
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?,Huh?
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.,You will.
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.,They won't.
How come you don't hate their guts?,I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
Duff, I love you.,Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
Where' you goin'?,'Round town.
What's so hot 'round town?,Take it easy, Frankie.
Just get her drunk.,How 'bout the key?
Good-bye, Frankie.,'Got a good thing, man.
'You Will Anderson?,Who're you?
Nothing. Heard you were in town.,Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Want me to hold the light for you?,No, thanks.
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?,Okay.
How often is that?,He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Come back some other time, will you?,Yeah, sure. Good luck.
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.,No thanks, Lee.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.,Sure.
They'll run you out.,No, they won't.
I know he wasn't much of a father.,Who is?!
Hello.,How are you?
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.,Thank you.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?,I guess I ain't.
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?,Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.,I guess not.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.,Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.,What d'you know about women, Pop?
Well, I got married to one of them.,Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Come on, Will.,What's the matter?! You mad at me?
Pour your own trouble, Will.,Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
Shut up, Will.,Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
Your Raoul?,Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--,Omar, listen to me--
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.,Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.,Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
How long's it been?,I'm still on my honeymoon.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?,Of course.
What are you doing in here?,The Elders, mon...
Can you get us into Straylight?,Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
What's an A.I.,An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.,You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.,Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?,I'd say you were full of shit.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?,Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.,It hasn't yet.
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.,You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.,You'll be linked during the entire operation.
Yeah, well it's working.,Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
The access code to your mainframe.,Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?,Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.,Yeah. That was me.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.,As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...,Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.,The girl 3Jane. We need her.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.,Can you walk?
Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?,Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?,Right...
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?,What?
Never heard of him.,Nobody has.
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.,It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.,Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.,No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?,We run. You crack the pattern?
It'll flatline your ass.,Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.,How long, Dixie?
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.,Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
How much time you got left?,Less than thirty minutes.
What about the mainframe's access code?,3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?,People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Where did you here that?,Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.,What's my end?
What is it?,... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.,If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.,Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
...Feels like you.,Case...
Case... it's four a.m.,I don't sleep much. You packed?
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.,We've still got to find the mainframe.
Who?,Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.,Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
How long will they watch us for?,Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.,Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?,Petty good.
What is with this school and prom?,Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.,Yeah, I know.
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?,Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?, uhh, must have forgotten-
Remember, that poet that we liked  the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.,Right. 7:30.
Oh, man! Who told?,Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?,Yeah.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.,Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Senorita Josie.,And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
Hi!,
You need my help?,No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
Wow. It's packed.,It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
Wings?,We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
He is totally crunching on you.,Do I want to be crunched?
Well, excuse me for caring about words.,So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
How many times have I fired her?,Five-- Six--
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.,But I don't want it straightened out.
Do you even know these kids?,They hid my car--
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.,Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
That's your story!,You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!,Are you in special ed?
Maybe we should go in a different room?,I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-,Yes. I'll go. Yes.
Hey--what are you thinking about?,Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
Better person than I.,See!
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!,Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
It's just for a couple of months.,You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
Wow. This must be big.,I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
Josie Grossie.,I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.,This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
You're twenty-three years old!,With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.,And a gymnast!
Dorothy Parker--,You like her?
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.,Thank you.
This seat taken?,Thank you.
Yoooooow.,Don't look down!
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.,That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
You have to say that. You're my teacher.,I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.,When are you going to open your eyes?
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.,Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!,What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?,Yeah, I have.
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.,But now you don't have to--
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!,I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
Please. Please don't walk away.,I just can't look at you the same way.
Yes.,What?
I don't know.,The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.,We're very evolved.
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.,Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?,Well, a ball player.
By name.,Lock.
If you went away, what would become of me?,I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...,Just what?
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?,Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.,Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.,He's conducting experiments of his own.
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>,<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
We're here!  You sent for us!,Specifically.
<i>                      I say that we take a cannon Aim it at his door and then Knock three times and when he answers Sandy Claws will be no more.</i>,<i>                      You're so stupid, think now -- If we blow him up to smithereens, We may lose some pieces and then Jack will beat us black and green.</i>
<i>                                          ... You're no fun.</i>,<i>                      Shut up and listen...!</i>
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.,And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.,Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?

I figured you might like some help.,Yeah?

Are you okay.,Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?,I don't know.
Any ghosts in here?,C'mon, cut it out.
Anything?,Uh-uh.  Wait...
What is it?,I don't know - a sharp pain.
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.,What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.,We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...,I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.,No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
Jess?,Huh?
So, school going alright?,Okay, I guess.
Maybe we should call a doctor.,No.  I'm okay.
There's a Jesse on the phone.,Okay...thanks.
What's that?,We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.

We're not always as good at things as we'd like.,Yeah, but I was really not good.
What's that?,I don't know.
Kristen, can you pull us out?,They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
Are you okay?,I think so.
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.,What?
Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?,Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.,A little basic, but nice.
You need me, I'll be here all night.,Thanks, Max.
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.,Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
This is nice.,Never been here before?
Must have opened while I was away at school.,Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?,I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
I'm serious.,Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?,That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
Just until we get things under control.,Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
To who?,Doesn't matter.
You sound like Peter Pan.,Remember -- open mind.
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.,Anything?
Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.,Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?,Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.,How do we get in?
We've got work to do.,What are you talking about?
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.,Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.,Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
That's enough, Kincaid.,There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
What do you think of the guinea fowl?,I'm a vegetarian.
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.,Now you're lying.
Oh Jesus.,Here, let me help.
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.,No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.,Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?,No thanks.
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?,Really, no.
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.,You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.,And what happens next in the dream?
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.,Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
Okay -- fine.,But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.,You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
Okay.,Okay.

Eleven.,Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
Cartwright.,'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.,What do you think?
You've got big feet.,Yes.  Always have had.
Well...,No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...,But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Can I stay a bit longer?,Stay forever.
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.,I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.,Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.,That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
Excuse me.,Yes.
Can I have your autograph?,What's your name?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.,I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
He's bringing a girl?,Miracles do happen.
Yes.,The movie star?
No.  Not true...,C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.

Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.,Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
I'll see what I can do.,Still, not sparkling.

Mr. Thacker?,Yes?
Are you a fan of Henry James?,This is Henry James film?
Cappuccino as ordered.,Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...,Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?,No -- did you?
Buggered?,Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Well?,She's perfect, perfect.
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.,Is it someone we know?
So -- you've laid the ghost.,I believe I have.
Does she know you're coming?,No, no.  She doesn't.
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.,Point taken.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.,Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.,Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.,So -- any messages?
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.,You're welcome.  Did you find them?
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?,I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
Yes.,Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.,Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
I'll talk to you in the morning.,Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.,Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
What's going on?,I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Why?,I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Yes, Mister Harding?,Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
Yes, Billy?,I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!,Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Yes, ma'am...,Will you come with me, please.
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.,Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
On this ward?,Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Oh, I had them removed.,What for?
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.,You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?,No way.

Right!,A nickel.
Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.,No! I wanna go!
I wanna see it...,Me too! Me too!
Jesus God...,What is it?
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.,I see...
To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...,Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
I don't, Doc...,Arrested on an assault charge five times...

It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...,Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay,'Kay!
How do ya know that?,Because I quit breathing.
Up an' at 'em, Taber.,What's going on?
Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it.,I don't believe it...
Somebody's coming!,Shhh!  This way!
Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac.,I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside.
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!,Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?,He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
A dime.,Okay. Who else?
Oh yeah...,I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...,Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...
You know, I never got your name.,Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Who is he?,He's in charge.
Hit me!,Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
Yes, I see it! I see it!,Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.,After you, ma'am.
What kind of crap is that???,Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
What happened?,What's that?
Is he in an asylum?,He's dead.
I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...,You ol' fucker!
Your grandmother?,Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
What?...,I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
I don't get it.  She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?,She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.,Except possibly that.
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.,No.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.,But, Faith--
Congratulations.,Thanks.
Smoking or non-smoking?,Non.  Please.
Hello?  Is anybody there?,Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?,Who's this?
WAIT!!  Where are you?,I'm at the airport.  Why?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.,Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
That's not the point.,You said whatever it was you would understand.
Are you okay?  You want some help?,NO.
Why can't you just tell me?,If it's any of your business, yes.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.,He's safe.
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.,Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
Why not?,Because.  I know where he is.
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...,Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...,Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
Hey--,What?
So were you.,Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.,No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
Is something the matter?,GET OUT!!
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.,Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
Really?...,Yes.
I was hoping for the real thing.,I brought you that, too.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?,Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
So what do you think?,Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Faith, this is my mother.,Oh, hello.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?,A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.,Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
I don't have an Amana freezer.,It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
No.,Is he married?
I don't know.  I don't think so.,So?...
Why don't you ask him?,Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.,Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.,I know.  You're right.
It's a miracle.,It's a coincidence.
You okay?,Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
Now what do we do?,The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?,Larry bought himself cologne?
What did you say to her?,I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.,I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.,Is he looking at us?
That was really sweet...,I meant about my idea.
I think it's time we got some professional help.,Like a detective.
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?,Packing.
Why?,Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.,So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.,The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
Joan Collins stayed here.,Is Damon Bradley here?
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.,Yup.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.,When you could've found one in America.
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?,He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
And you are?...,Kate.
How old are you?,What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.,You don't have to go if you don't want to...
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.,You miss me?...
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.,You used to love it when I called you doll.
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?,What?  You know him?
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.,Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.,It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.,That's really romantic.
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.,Thanks.
Right now?,He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
I'm gonna take her home first.,I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.,The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.,I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
I wish I knew.,So do I, Charley. For your sake.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.,In a minute.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.,But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's ,Thicker than water.
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!,Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
What happened?  What happened?,Tommy, what happened?
You know how the Sisters are.,You training to be a nun or something?
I can get home all right from here,The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
What for?,I don't know.
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.,I am?
No thanks... .,Hit me again, Mac.
Terry!,Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.,Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
His racket?,You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
You're not sore at me?,What for?
Edie!,I I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
Edie... Edie... ..,Terry, what's wrong?
I've been sittin' in the church.,You?
Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me he says it's up to me.,Who says?
Terry what's happening to you?,I just told the Father.
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.,How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
I know what you want me to do!,I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.,I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
Terry, no, no... .,Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
But I feel like My friends won't talk to me.,Are you sure they're your friends?
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.,He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.,Someone else c'n take your confession.
It started as a favor for my brother you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no a favor Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.,What are you going to do?
Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?,Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.,Baseball bats that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.,O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
I think you could have.,If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him boy, I was ready that night.
Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs again.  Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him?,Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher hooks over 'n under   whop-whop!
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.,You'd be off the pier for good.
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .,Looking for me?
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!,Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
Terry?  What do you want?,Hey look-
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?,I'll bring him up to your loft.
I I musta counted wrong, boss, I,Gimme.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.,I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Yeah, yeah Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.,I can't believe it a small fortune.   You can't buy me you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
A banana boat. It would be bananas.  One of these days me ship's comin' in from Ireland,  God love 'er, loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey!,Nolan, me lad, ye're dreamin' again.
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.,When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.,Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
Could it be some kind of college initiation?,It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
What do you mean?,I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.,I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
You're talking nonsense.,Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>,I should hope not.  I hate you!
That sudden?,Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.,I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
You love me then?,Of course I do.
But they are not yet one of us.,A situation easily remedied.
...And what is this?,A symbol, Master.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.,It would seem so, Master.
There are others.,Well then let us proceed.
They are live ones?,Yes, Master.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.,I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
No. No! No!,I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.,Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
He wants us.,Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
I could make her another Cleopatra...,Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.,Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.,What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...,And the one driving the other car?
Glenn Michaels.,Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
Oh, is this Adele?,Yes, it is.
Lie face down on the floor.,What?!
Yes.,Tell me, how do you do that?
You didn't visit him in prison.,He didn't want me to.
He called the day he escaped.,He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.,Oh.  Uh-huh.
You did work for Emil, right?,Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
You say you perform in the Miami area?,Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
I'm not dressed.,Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.,How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.,You're right.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.,There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.,I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
Just that she got away.,Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
What?!,You better come see this.
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.,He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.,Shit.
Nice disguise.,I'm a tourist.
You at least bring the gun?,In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.,Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.,He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
How long you talk to her?,Two hours.
How long were you with the girl?,Forty-five minutes.
And she saw you?,Yes, she did.
Come <i>on</i>.,Shit.
What?,They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
We made it, didn't we?,All you gotta do is get in.
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.,Jack --
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.,Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?,Is that what you would've done?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.,Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
That's all I wanted to know.,Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?,Call and tell you.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.,Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
Quite a mess.,Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.,Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
How much for your company at chow?,Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
I bet.  How much?,Another C.
Like being back in the yard, huh?,Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.,We're leaving.
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?,Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?,You're right.  So why take a chance--
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?,The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
Why, are you famous?,Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
You don't seem all that scared.,Of course I am.
You don't act like it.,What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.,Uh-huh.
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.,With Robert Redford, when he was young.
I mean, romantically.,Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
How'd you get this number?,Who was it answered the phone?
None of your business.,I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.,Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?,Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.,I can go to the bar.
Don't leave me.,Those guys bother you?
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?,No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.,Yeah, but in a nice way.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.,He killed a police officer.
I wasn't sure you caught that.,I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
You're not dumb.,I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
You getting serious on me now?,I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
Come on, Jack -- don't.,Pretend I'm somebody else.
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.,Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
So.  What's your point?,My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled.",Yeah?  She said that to you?
Looks like tonight.,You know who they are?
Sounds high, doesn't it?,Must be a real soft pillow.
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.,Really?  Well, I uhhh...
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.,No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
I know what you're talking about.,You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.,Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.,Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.,No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.,How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
Foley?  That you?,How are you, Richard?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.,A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
Good God... they're shooting Midge!,Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.,I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
I were you, I'd get up and run.,I'm not leaving Midge.
<i>Hejira?</i>  What kinda name is that?,Islamic.
What's it mean, "No Hair"?,The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
The flight?,The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.,Hejira.
And so now you're off to Glades.,Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
She did, huh.,Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
Glenn, take the exit.,No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.,You're not?
I wanna talk to you about a job.,Uh-huh.
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.,Oh...
You're not my type.,Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.,You not with probation, one of those?
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.,Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
No thanks.,You used to like it.
I really gotta go.,We don't get to talk much any more.
He doesn't even look like that.,No?
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.,Hello?
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.,I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
He waved to you?,I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.,He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
You here all by yourself?,That's right, just me.
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...,The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
Did you pay the guy the reward?,Yeah, as soon as we got back.
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.,So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
What?,Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Faux goose down.,Still...
Midge.,Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Foley's got it.,Where the fuck is Foley?
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?,You mean hiding them?
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.,Sir, I --
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!,You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.,Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Bandits at 2 o'clock.,Power dive!
Nah, you go on.,I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
Waitress!  Four beers!,You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
I'm out of ammo!,I'm out of fuel!
It's shorter than our practice runway.,They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
It's not getting any longer.,Longer?  It's getting shorter.
Yeah.,We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.,Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
How's everything?,We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
Sorry.,He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.,The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.,Why were you sitting here, instead of...
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.,How did you?...
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.,I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.,It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.,It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.,We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.,The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.,Have the planes made it to China?
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.,If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?,It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.,I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..,How do you like my hair?
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.,Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.,Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
Carol!,Peggy Sue!
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.,You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.,Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
The only one?,Well, besides Charlie, of course.
We're going to take you home.,That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
I don't get it.,That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?,Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.,That's disgusting!
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.,I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.,Charlie! Am I dead?
How do you feel?,Pretty strange.
Where did you get that sweater?,Great, isn't it?
Right. I promised my mother.,Is this slow enough for you?
He's trying.,Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?,Who?
What do you know about classical music?,Nothing.. Selling is selling.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.,And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?,I just can't trust you anymore.
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?,Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
Does this mean you like me again?,It means I care about you and what happens to you.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?,Right here. Now sit down.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.,I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...,Charlie? Was I dead?
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".,Oh, God, Dion.
Hello, Charlie.,Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Are you for real?,Touchy, touchy!
It was Beth's idea.,I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.,It must run in the family.
Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.,He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.,But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.,A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
Coffee and a donut.,I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.,What are you shooting for?
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.,That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.,What?
Young lady, you're drunk!,Just a little. I've had a tough day.
Yes.,That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.,You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
Oh, you're both so naive.,Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -how could you do that?,Please don't shout.
Jack, I was just trying to help.,We'll make it, we'll be fine.
Who was that man?,It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?,It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.,She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?,What do you mean?
Would they go over my girdle or under?,Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
Isn't that awfully forward?,We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.,Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.,I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
Dancing with you.,You're a sweet man, Richard.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.,It really wasn't that difficult.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.,I	know what a burrito is.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.,What's inside?
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes,So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.,Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.,How, did you know about my grandfather?
What're you doing?,Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.,Wbat're you talking about?
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.,Come on. You can't be serious.
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.,That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.,Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?,No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?,Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
What will they be made of?,I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?,No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.,Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?,I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.,Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
What's the matter?,It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...,The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--,--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.,Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
Is something wrong?,Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?,Sure.
Who was that?,Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.,He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.,Just until he heals up?
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?,I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...,What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
You want me to help?,You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
How can he not have a heartbeat?,Maybe it takes a while...
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?,I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
How long have you been here?,Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.,Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
What's wrong with your face?,What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
You're right, I probably just misfiled...,Andy?
This time. What about next time?,There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please?,I am relaxed.
Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.,I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
Fuck you.,Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
What's wrong with you?,Close the law book.
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!,The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
You don't think there's much time left, do you?,That's not what I said.
What's that mean?!,Maybe you should think about it.
Thanks, Charles.,No sweat, buddy.
I know that, Charles.,More than your friend. Family.
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.,Don't do this, Andy.
Innocuous?,Defined by Webster's as harmless.
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?,I have AIDS.
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...,It's okay. Can I sit down?
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.,You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
Correct. I'm seeking representation.,Continue.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.,We?
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?,Makeup.
Big trouble.,Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.,Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
Who'd you get?,What?
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.,They didn't fire her?
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.,Thank you.
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?,Sure. It's fine.
When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.,Uh huh...
Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...,What have you prayed for?
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.,There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
We proceed, representing your estate.,I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.  God, Andy, you look awful.,Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?,Something like that.
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?,That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?,I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?,No.
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.,Absolutely.
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?,Yes.
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?,Yes.
In what way?,Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.,Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
We're going to draw blood.,Why are we going to do that?
Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?,Wyant Wheeler represented us.
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?,That's correct.
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.,In a word, yes.
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...,But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?,Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
I'll see you in an hour, max.,Night, honey.
Right.,Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.,Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I...
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.,With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!,Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
I've discovered something interesting, Charles.,... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
... But we shouldn't have fired him...,... It's time to get this society back on track!
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.,Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
Bottle-count.,Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
You did this? To yourself?,Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Riddick? What the hell are you --,<u>Listen</u>.
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!,Riddick? How close?
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!,We can't make it.
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..,Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
Just come with me!,Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
Here. Make it easy on you.,Don't do this to me....
Just give me your hand.,But they...they could still be....
There....,Like the light is scalding it.
How many bottles?,Not sure. Ten?
And him?,Big Evil?
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.,Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.,Probably right.
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.,During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --,Shut up.
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --,<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?,Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?,You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --,60 years ago.
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.,-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
Dancin' on razor blades here...,I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?,And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!,'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
Smoke screen for what?,For your own fear.
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?,We're just burnin' light here.
Just shut up, okay?,-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.,Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
One is all?,For now.
Hasan?,Riddick?
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.,I would rather we all stay--
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?,Has anyone checked the coring room?
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --,There is no "safe."
Suleiman!,Get the girl back under. Keep going.
SULEIMAN!,KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.,Like an emergency life-raft, right?
Such as.,Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.,Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
What's her name, anyway?,What do you care?
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?,Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
An' this?,Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
You were tryin' to kill him too.,Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
Take it.,What, it's broken?
How did you know we'd come here?,It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
I apologize.,To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.,Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
Seal the cave?,That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.,Do you have any weapons?
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.,You still don't believe me, do you?
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.,No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.,And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
Look -- she remembers.,Remembers what?
Flight is a scientific impossibility.,And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.,Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
Well, maybe they're not.,No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!,Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.,Zira....
We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.,Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.,Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.,Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
Good morning, Dr. Zira.,Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
Landon! Send a last signal.,What signal?
It's no use ... there she goes.,Forget it. Abandon ship.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.,You don't seem very cut up about it.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.,Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
If only we could get a fix.,What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing,Climb off me, will you!
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.,But I'm not prepared to die.
I want her.,If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
Gorilla hunters ...,Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.,Why special?
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.,Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
You lied. Where is your tribe?,My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.,All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.,That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.
Tell him to pull back!,Cease fire! Withdraw!
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?,Listen, listen -- I can speak --
Speak! Go on.	Speak again.,My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
It's him...Landon.,Which one?
Taylor! Tell him.,He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
It's humiliating.,Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
Would you like to come along?,We can't.
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.,All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.,God bless you.
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?,Yes, Sir.
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?,He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.,He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.,How the hell did he get away?
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!,YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?,Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.
So what's the problem?,Says he can't walk.
Sarge?,Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.,Fuck you bitch.
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?,Das right dude. You be tryin' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke.
Say I can dig it. Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know?  Y'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become 'pacifists' so's we don fight  Where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what - bunch of hopheads, they think they special...,Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.,Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
Yeah?,Only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe.
Fuck this shit!,You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god, I hope so - I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa! 
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...,Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!,Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
Where's Lerner?,Out there man - behind the log.
...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.,...don't feel like it either.
And you, do you believe?,In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
Okay - got light duty, three days.,Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
You WHAT? Say 'gain.,Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam...
...you know that night we got hit... I... ,Fuck it, don't mean nothing, no such thing here as a coward, done your best man, next time y'do better.
Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.,What are the heads?
Must be somebody?,...there's nobody.
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.,Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.,They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.,Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.,So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.,That's what he is... Baaaa!
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.,How far does this train go?
I'll make one for you.  I live there.,Well..
The brush-off, huh?,I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
I think I'd like to dance.,Why certainly, baby.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?,Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.,I see.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.,I see.
I didn't say anything.,I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.,He got in here how?
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?,Sure... but somebody always does..
How did you meet him?,On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
Want a spike in it?,No thanks.
Certainly not to me.,Just who are you, anyway?
I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.,No percentage in that.
They're going to arrest me.,I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.,That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- ,Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.,Killaine...
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.,Including Killaine.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.,I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.,I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.,So that I will never be found.
Mine?,Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
Mitchell was dead enough.,And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?,But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
Beer or ale, Miss?,Ale. I don't mind.
Please answer my question.,You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
That's an evasion and you know it.,It is?
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?,Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.,They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.,Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
I expected nothing else.,I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
They call me Jeff.,Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
Time's up.  I'm off the case. ,They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.,Because you think your in love with me?
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.,To do what?
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.,I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.,This way.
Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.,You asked for it.
I go home and paint the kitchen.,For two hundred?
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night,Why not here?
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?,In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.,Fascinated.
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?,Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
All right, let's see the buzzer.,What's a buzzer?
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.,You're not English.
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.,How's life treating you?
Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?,Hardly. Who's the girl?
In case you want to have us followed.,I don't.
I have a warrant for her arrest.,That must hurt.
Mitchell was too drunk.,Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.,I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?,You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.,That's not enough.
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.,How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
Got a moment, Inspector?,I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.,Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
You in charge here?,So it seems Sergeant.
Right.,I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night.  Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?,I'll know when I find it.
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two.",Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
Was that about the right angle?,I think so.
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?,If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?,Do I know who lives down there?
You can find out.,Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.,If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.,And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?,I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
Scotch and plain water, I think.,Warm water, no doubt.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?,I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.,Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
I am a fool.,That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!,You didn't play it for laughs last night.
It does.  May I go now? ,I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
Now, you're being beastly.,Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?,The card says so, doesn't it?
I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?,She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
Get out of here!,What are my orders, sir?
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?,Why should I mind?
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?,You ought to know why.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.,Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.,You don't have to make a pose of it.
Of course.,How about your new friend?
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.,I say YES!
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.,Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.,Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?,It's fine, thank you.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?,Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.,Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Shall we go?,Yes.
Thank you.,Sit on that log, dear.
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.,That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts?
Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.,Very good.
Terrific.,But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
Committed to memory.  Forever.,I see.
Can I give you a lift?,No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
I thought it was tremendous.,I think it went on rather too long.
I couldn't bear for it to end.,And I didn't like that man.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.,Both dead.
I called you a taxi.,Very thoughtful.
In radio we're different.,I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
Jeremy phoned this morning,What did he want?
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.,Are you up to something?
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.,My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
Okay, I will.,She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?,All right.
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.,Next time tell her I've gone away.
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.,The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.,Now listen...
We'll see what we can do.,Promise?
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?',Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
And that's why you never went pro?,Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?,Not yet.
What's their program?,They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?,No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.,I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.,Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
Ever done this before?,Once.
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.,Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!,You first!
Talk.,She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
You gotta tell me where she is.,And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
Three seconds... two... one...,SHIT!!
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?,Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?,Zero distortion, sir.
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.,Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?,So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
Sorry.,Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?,Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?,No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.,Thanks, buddy.
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.,Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?,He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Aw shit.,Nice tattoo, Dietz.
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.,Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
Time for lunch.,Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?,I'm serious.
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.,Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.,Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?,Sure.
Look at you.,What?
Those are cold.,Warm them up.
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?,Tyler, put the gun down.
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--,Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
Bye.,Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?,No way, old buddy.
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?,Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.,The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
Thanks.,Anytime.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...,What, Sergeant?
Any sign of the hostages?,We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.,The best friend I ever had.
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?,He knows our defenses.
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?,Philip!  We'll need shoes!
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.,Please, we hardly know each other.
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --,You what?
I... I would take advantage of it.,How?
Stolen?,Not exactly.
<u>Ho</u>tel.,Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
You're joking.,I never joke about money.
No, but it's getting there.,Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
Try a strawberry.,Why?
Good morning.,You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
Vivian --,C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
The Rex.,Any good?
I think you'll approve.,... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.,I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Was someone rude to you?,I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
What about dinner?,Dinner can wait.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?,Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
You still mad at'm?,He died a long time ago.
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.,I'm sure that's true for some of them.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.,Ready to stomp sod?
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.,I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?,I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?,It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
Right.,It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.,Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.,We're letting them slide?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.,But, Edward...
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.,The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
Doing what?,Vivian's in sales.
Why do you want to know?,Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.,So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
What!?,Have a good day, gentlemen.
Edward, we've been together ten years.,And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.,I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.,He's not gonna want us.
Yeah.,Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.,Was that you?
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.,Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.,I pray for that.
What kind of school?,School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
Want a pair of boots?,Do I!?  Momma!
You bullshittin' me?,Of rent I do not bullshit.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?,I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
I got a dress.,I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?,That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.,Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
Either you're European or badly brought up.,Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.,I like steak.
Are you looking for something in particular?,Yes.  Something... conservative.
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?,I don't think it would fit you.
What?,It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.
Get out!,Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?,May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.,I swear it will be done.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.,I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.,You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.,Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.,As you wish.
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.,I will never doubt again.
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?,Gently.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.,It never happened.
What?,It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife.",Did you say, "I do"?
No more rhymes now, I mean it.,Anybody want a peanut?
Faster!,I thought I was going faster.
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.,What do I do?
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.,Yes, some of the time. 
I don't think more than ten.,That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
-- Fezzik, please --,Everybody ... MOVE!!
Have you any money?,I have a little.
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.,How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?,Over the Albino, I think.
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.,Because I can stop now if you want.
Yes.,All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.,My spy network has heard no such news.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.,I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!,DEATH FIRST!!
A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.,No.  To the pain.
Could this be a trap?,I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.,Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
No.,In that case --
You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.,Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
No --,-- offer me money --
-- yes --,-- power too -- promise me that --
What? What?,Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
Humiliations galore!,That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
Slow going?,Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
I do not suppose you could speed things up?,If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
Do you always begin conversations this way?,My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
How old were you?,I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
You've done nothing but study swordplay?,More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
Who are you?!,No one of consequence.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?,Australia.
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.,Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
Your grandfather's here.,Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!,That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.,What are you saying?
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.,How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
Oooooooops!,Ooooooops.
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...,Do the books!  Do the books!
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.,Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.,I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.,Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.,Oh, it's all right ... wha?
What did I do?,You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
What???,Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
I'm not going to jump on you!,Aaaaaaaaaa!
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.,They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.,Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
Where would you like to eat?,Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.,You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.,You found a flop!
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.,Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.
What are you doing?,I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.,Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
To failure!,To failure!
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!,What???
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.,Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.,Really, I never dreamed ...
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?,Yes.  We would!
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...,You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Always.,Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
Do it!  Do it!,I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
Do you need us?,Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.,Oh, the best one.
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.,I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.,And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.,Ta.  Ta.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.,Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
The Blue Max...,The Blue Max...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.,And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.,Vat?
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.,I mean in show business.
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.,What do you do best?
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.,Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.,In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
You out to buy a motel?,No.
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?,What?
No.,Or arrived with her.
No.,She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
Cash.,And when she left, she never came back.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...,She isn't still here, is she?
She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.,If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
No. I told you, she's confined...,Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?,Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...,It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...,I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.,I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...,But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.,I don't need pills... just sleep.
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.,Buzz me the minute she comes in.
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....,I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...,Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!,Like what?
I still feel...,Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
Is something wrong?,I want to know if my sister is here.
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?,Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.,Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
What thing could we be in together?,I hate tears. 
Is Mary... in trouble?,Yes.
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...,It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.,He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
I ought to call the police right now!,No.
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?,How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
Where... can I stay?,First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
It's been three.,Are we just going to go on sitting here?
Probably on his way back right now.,Sam, I'm going.
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.,Where could he have gone?
Let's go see Al Chambers.,Who's he?
Our Deputy sleeps.,Well?
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.,Does that mean we can't...
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.,I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.,Of course we will.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.,This is the old highway.
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.,You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
You can't go up there.,Why not?
We could laze around here a while longer.,Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.,I've lost my girlish laughter.
And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.,You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...,I haven't even been married once yet!
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.,Sam, let's go get married.
How can you even think a thing like that!,Don't miss your plane.
Dirty night.,You have a vacancy?
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.,There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.,I'd like to.
You eat like a bird.,You'd know, of course.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.,Uncommon, too.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.,Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
Why don't you go away?,To a private island, like you?
Thank you, Norman.,Norman.
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...,Very early. Dawn.
Frankly, yes.,Please... I'd like to go...
Oh?,Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.,He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
Norman took a wife?,No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...,Arbogast.
Satisfied with your cabin?,Fine.
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?,Yes.
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place...,This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?,Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
They thought she'd be coming to me.,Left Phoenix under her own steam?
Yes.,From what?
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?,Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--,I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.,Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.,How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.,That's it. You get it quick.
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.],By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?,Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
What are you going to do?,I'm going to call the police.
You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.,Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
You're losing your blood?,Yes!
That spoke to you?,That called ... commanded ...
There's no child here.,But ... the dogs...
You lie!,It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue! 
But what about lunch?,I'll have it for supper.  So long.
Why didn't you eat last night?,Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.,I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.,Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
I think so.,Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?,Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
Why, certainly, sir. My fiance. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.,Delighted, I'm sure. 
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?,I'm not quarreling, only ...
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.,I'd call it stupid at any time.
But I think these things are beautiful.,They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.,It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
Let me go! Let me go!,We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
What! What are you talking about?,The body of Joan Gale!
Meaning what?,That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.,I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.,Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!,Nope, I'm through!
Which one is me? The horse?,Get out of here.
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?,I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
I am right! I know I'm right!,Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!,Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!,Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
What do you mean?,That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.,You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.,Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
That's what I said.,I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.,Where were you going when you got in that cab?
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?,Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?,I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
No kiddin'.,I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.,What does that prove?
Fine, thanks.,Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.,Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.,Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.,No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!,That is unfortunate.
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.,Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?,I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.,And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.,Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
Have you got it? Is it completed?,Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --,Thanks.
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?,Dad...
Two: what if I didn't miss?,You did.
Mia...?,Yes....
Dysfunctional --,That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
I know, Mother.,But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.,Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.,But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.,Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
Actually, I am, though.,You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?,I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
You better quit that.,But Rose...
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.,But why, if I'm not hurting you?
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.,Good night, Rose.
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.,Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.,He did?
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?,Five hundred rabbits?
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.,Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
Son, was Rose in your room last night?,No. Why should Rose be in my room?
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?,Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?,No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
The new girl is here.,Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?,Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?,This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.,Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.,Oh, shut up, Buddy.
There goes Mother.,Yeah.
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!,Let me see!
Now I can't see. What are they doing?,Boy! Wow!
He had his hand on her titty.,Let me look.  Aww-rr...
What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?,They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?,Doll, don't ask childish questions.
How could that be, son?,Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.,Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.,Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?,At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.,Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?,I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!,She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
Please do.,I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
Of course.,I think we both know her.
How goes it, darlin'?,Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.,Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.,There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole.,I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?,No reason at all, darlin'.
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.,Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
Boys? You say to me boys?,Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.,Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.,I don't care where the polecat studied.
Honey!,She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly.
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,,Who?
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?,Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!,No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.,Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Goddamn you, girl! You've made me make a fool out of myself, damn your hide, but let me tell you I am standing at the pass of Thermopylae and I won't budge! The very idea, my own home with children in the house, to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h, you had better believe I am standing at Thermopylae, you little nut, you had better believe it! What are you, crazy? A man is supposed to be a fool like this, but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense! Are you a nitwit? What's the matter with you?,Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer... I just... couldn't help myself. I'm sorry...
You're so sweet.,If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.,Well, it has buttons.
Is this ill right?,It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
Strange voices, Rose?,Yes, sir.
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!,Well. What kinda job is it?
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.,What?
You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?,Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.,Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.,What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Galley what?,Page proof of a book I'm working on.
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?,Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?,That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.,Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?,Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.,Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.,You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.,She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.,It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.,You can stop it right now.
Oh, no, ma'am.,Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
Are you going to get your degree soon?,Well, I am working on my thesis.
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.,Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
I don't want to go to the dentist.,Be quiet, Rose.
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!,Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
No more dentists, no more dentists...,It'll get better now.
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?,Yes, ma'am.
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?,What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.,Yeah, it's kinda nice.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.,I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.,I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
Rose, you don't have to.,I don't mind.
Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?,... okay... you made your point.
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.,Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
How much?,I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
This is private property.  This is breaking and entering!,Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?,Alright!  Alright... put me down...
What'd I say?,It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
You shouldn't litter.,Thank you, concerned citizen.
Sons of bitches!,We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
I can work this.,No you can't.
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!,Relax.
All I got is being a cop.  What do I do if I'm not that?,You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you.  And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of.  You of all people...
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!,Stop blaming yourself.
Wh... what... ?!,Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
I don't know what the problem is. Plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle,Name one.
Why do I always have to sit in back?,It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Birth control's important.,What... what kinda thing is that to say?
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?,Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !,Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?,No.
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.,You can't be serious.
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!,You're about an inch away from insubordination!
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?,It's our job.
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?,Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.,Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
I'm gonna get beside him.,No you're not.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.,No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
I can't believe I'm hearing this,,I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
That's not true.,I know it is, even if you don't.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!,Out here.  On your knees.
Come again... ?,Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.,Who is that... ?
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?,Seatbelts fastened, please.
We're screwed.,I'm well aware of that.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.,The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
Your eyesight will return in time.,Where am I?
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.,You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
What is thy bidding, my Master?,Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
Wouldn't miss it.,How are we doing?
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.,Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.,Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Hey!,Han, don't. It'll be all right.
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!,That's all any of us can see.
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.,No, wait! I thought you were blind!
Good luck.,You, too.
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.,Good, I hate long waits.
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.,You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.,Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
Oh!,Your Royal Highness.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.,I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.,You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
Master Yoda, you can't die.,Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
Yoda, I must know.,Your father he is.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?,I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.,I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.,Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
He might be.  I don't know.,Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.,Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
Oh....Say something.,Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
Right!,We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.,And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.,So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
Hello.,Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.,You know this earth - this person.
Great Heavens, that's a laser.,Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never,I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
What guy,Makes you cry
Feeling,Like I'm outside in the rain
Oh, no no, no no.,Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.,Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?,...I don't know.
It's Thanksgiving.,To you, to me it's Thursday.
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.,Absolutely.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?,By accident?
Some people are very shy by nature.,...I suppose.
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.,...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.,I don't think you're a bum.
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.,Do you have a phone?
D'you really wanna call?,Yes, I do.
Would ya take off your glasses?,What?
...T-thank you.,Do me another favor?
...And he called the reporters --,Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
Wanna hear a dirty joke?,...Yes --
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --,Don't say that.
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.,Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.,Paul.
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.,You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
...That man's takin' his job too serious.,He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.,One more round.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!,...Thanks.
How was the flight, Champ?,Very high an' very fast.
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?,That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.,...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.,No dollar.
Nine minutes!,Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --,Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.,I agree.
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.,The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.,Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?,...Fine.
Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?,No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.,Yeah.
Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat.,...Thanks.
Rocky, would you be interested in --,Sparrin'?
What?,I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?,Hey --
Make your teeth yella --,I like yella teeth.
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --,Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.,...Tomato?
How old?,Come July, twenty-five.
Did ya get the message, kid?,Message -- What message?
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.,Yeah.
How you holdin' up, kid?,Fine... That guy's great.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?,'Bout what?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.,He ain't losin' nothin'.
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?,My sister's a friggin' loser.
Don't get mental, man.,Ya caught me in a bad mood.
I usta be deadly at half-ball.,I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Why?,Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
I'll do okay.,Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
How ya feelin'?,...Tight.
I got whiskey here.,...No.
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?,Whatta you think?
Ain't sure, what's the story?,What?
What gaps?,She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?,Whatta these guys want?
So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?,...People talk to me more.
Oh, a ladies man, huh?,My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.,You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...,C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.,Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.,Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.,Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
What's this, Roger?,A tweeting bird?
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!,Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.,You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
He's a riot.,Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
So you decided to help him after all?,I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?,If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
So what's the scam, Eddie?,Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.,What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
What's that comin' from the bar?,Sounds like singin'.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?,What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.,Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
They must've taken it off me.,They?
No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.,So you're Cloverleaf?
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?,Toons aren't given imperfections.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.,Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.,If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
I didn't know who I could trust.,We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
So where is it?,When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
Hold on a second.,Eddie, come on.
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?,No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?,One too many safes dropped on his head?
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.,So what do you want me to do?
When will I hear from you?,As soon as is humanly possible.
Valiant!  You surprised me.,That was the idea.
You tricked me, damn you!,Take it easy.
Pattycake!  Pattycake!,Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
Aah!,Aah!
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...,If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
What the hell are you doin' in there?,I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?,Yeah?
No, kid, you're a real hero.,I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.,And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.,I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.,[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.,Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Have patience!,Leave Me!
Romeo! Romeo!,Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.,Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
Good heart, at what?,At thy good heart's oppression.
Farewell, my cuz.,Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.,In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.,A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?,My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.,What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?,Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.,And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Juliet!,Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
[Within] Juliet!,By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
What?,Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.,Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?,Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?,The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.,Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.,I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.,Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.,Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
And so did I.,Well, what was yours?
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.,Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Ho Ho, Capital Punks!,Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.,Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.,I thought all for the best.
Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?,OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?,Of course.
We kept it...,Is that right?
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.,Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
I don't know.,When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
So what's the deal?,The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.,How do we know that?
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?,Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
What is?,Best beer in the world known to man or God.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?,It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!,Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.,Nobody's saying they don't.
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.,Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...,You sure about this?
Alright, Gregor, I'm...,Ready when you are...
Where's the case?,There's a problem...
Sit, sit...  Would you like one?,No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.,But you hate each other!
A means to an end, is that it?,That's it.
Then I guess we're set.,There is one other thing...
What are you doing?,Don't cross me...
And you respect him.,Of course.  Don't you?
You think you can stitch me up on you own?,Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.,You should really let a doctor look at that.
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.,Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
He sees this differently, as you well know.,I didn't expect that he would.
They call me Swede.,Who's they?
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.,I blast the lead car into oblivion...
Is that right?,It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
Something like that...,And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.,That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
What's going on?,I just wanted to see something.
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.,I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
I came up here to sneak a smoke.,You were smoking?
That makes twice now you've saved my life.,I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.,Not exactly.
You know him?,I know of him.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.,It's my job.
What the fuck happened?,I don't know...
Not here.  They might see it.,If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
Time to quit.,Just like that?
Let's get him out of here...,Finish the job...
And now...,Finish it!
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?,I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
What's the story?,It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.,Seamus Reilly.
You slept with her!,How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.,Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.,I get the picture.
Ready to roll, partner?,Sure thing, and --
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?,The horniest dog in Nevada.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.,Cash and what?
Ten thousand right here.,There must be over a million dollars in here.
Well someone's gonna find them.,Hell, it won't be us!
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!,We'll figure something out.
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.,I don't know.
I've got one condition.,What's that?
Shhh!,What are you gonna do?
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?,He saw everything!
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --,I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...,That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.,Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
It's the right thing to do.,It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!,He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!,All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
And how do you figure we do that?,All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
He's going to be trouble.,He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
You said that last time!,Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
You're out of your mind.,Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
You think he's bluffing?,No.
How long is it going to take?!,I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
Here it is.,There it is...now what about the others?
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!,You killed him...
Booth, listen to me...Booth!,He killed her...
Whoa, Earl!,OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...,I might have to look into that...
You got me something?  What's the occasion?,You deserve it is the occasion.
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.,He's not, he's...
You're worth every last penny.,Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.,I know.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...,It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
How are we going to do all this?,I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?,Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.,Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
Be more specific.  A month, a week...,A week ago, at most.
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.,We appreciate that.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.,Why would someone do that?
Sheriff Hogan --,Dwayne.
Yeah.,What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Let's see...do you know her cup size?,Uh...C?
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?,Sort of.
Something wrong, Jesse?,No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
Whatever...,Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!,Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
Dwayne please calm down!,Calm down --
I'm not asking.,Well you're not getting, either.
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --,We're gonna talk.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.,Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
Hi ma.,Hi.
I didn't know you were coming.,I was in the neighborhood.
How's work?,Well, same ol' same ol'.
Are you hungry?,Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
Don't you want it?,Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.,No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
It's nine-thirty in the morning.,Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
Two-hundred thousand!,Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
Winner!  Four, winner!,I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
Invitation, please.,I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.,Is this about the funny money?
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.,El Capitan?
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.,Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.,What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?,I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
You get massage from Chinese girl before?,No.  It's my first time.
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.,Oh yes, she's very nice.
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?,No.
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.,Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
I'm sorry.,Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.,Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.,Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.,You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
You lied to me.,I'm sorry.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!,Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.,I am a tourist.
What's wrong?,Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
I have plenty of dates.,Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.,No.  She's a school teacher.
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.,Ask me if I give a shit.
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.,This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
No, no, that would be crazy --,You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.,Why LA?
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...,Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Follow the Rich White Man?,Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.,Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.,She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
Wait!  There's people down there!,There's people up here!
Get it out of here!,Take it!
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.,She never even looked at you.
Are you okay?,What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
She saved our lives.,For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
Fine.,I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
I think we should stop talking.,Fine by me.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.,Mind your own business.
What about a little king pao chicken?,No kung pao chicken.  Never.
Are you serious?,Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.,End of the line.
Ricky Tan is alive.,What?!?!
That your gate down there?,Yes.
First class.,The Plaza Hotel?
A little Mu-shu.,Some Kung-Pao?
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?,Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.,Fine with me.
Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.,Why don't you go get them?
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?,No.  But I'll help you.
Are you okay?,I'm fine.
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?,Baby Duck?
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...,Did you tell Sterling?
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?,Yes, Master.
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.,Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
Who the hell is that?,That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
You know what a phone booth is?!,The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
Lee!  It's him!,The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
Good job.,Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
You talk very fast.,Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
Beach Boy.,You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
It's the same thing!,I am not responsible for your assumptions.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.,Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
That silly-ass look on your face.,I was being polite.
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.,Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
The license!  You get it?!,No.
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.,What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.,Don't go there...
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.,Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
What?,Stool pigeon.
You talk too fast.,Come on!
Now, that's American music.,Yes, I know this song.
That's not how it goes.,Yes, I think so.
Excuse me?,Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my hood.,No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
You're killin' me here.,Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
How about a lift home?,Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.,Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!,That's what you were supposed to be!
Hmmmm?,Don't play bullshit games with me.
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...,I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.,I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.,Nobody touches me.
You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.,What are you talking about?
Hello.,Ambassador Han.
I am so sorry about your men.,Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.,I was trying to find the right time.
What is he up to now?,Ike just came by to check out the team.
Got any last minute advice?,Maintain eye contact.
That's it.  Back to obedience school.,Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
And in a "V".,Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
Bob's in a hurry.,Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.,His hair... any color.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.,Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?,No.  No, you didn't.
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.,I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
Look, he's running after her.,Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.,Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...,What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.,But I'll get my normal fee, right?
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.,You're coming here?
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.,Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
Sorry, no.  I just got one.,Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.,It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?,Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
It's nice that they're still friends.,Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Yes, I am.  And who are you?,Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...,You have one?
That's fair.,Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
Give me that!,But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.,He is not!
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.,How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.,I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.,Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
I think so.,I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Always a mood killer.,Still sweet.
I'm a work in progress.,So?  Is that what you said to her?
No.,Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
You look... uh... You look fine.,Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Ike... Hi, Grandma.,Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.,No.  You take it.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?,No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.,Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?,Excuse me?
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?,Yes.
Yes I do!,No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
I love you.  I love you.,I love you, too.
And the church.,And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
I'm okay with that.,So am I.
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?,I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.,It's something I've always wanted to do.
Used?,They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.,I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.,For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.,Where?
I'm going to kill myself.,Why?
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!,No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.,I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
What happened at the luau?,... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.,Not eight...
What are you talking about?,Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.,Not this one.  This one's on me.
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.,Good boy, Port Hole.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.,Yeah.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.,Is there somebody else?
Nope.,You don't love me, is that it?
I hate boats.,It sounds nice.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.,No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --,-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?,Nope.
Happy New Year, darling.,Happy New Year.
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?,Walter, I'd love to --
We'll stay at the Plaza --,Go for a walk in Central Park --
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.,That doesn't make any sense.
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --,-- it was a betrayal.
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.,Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
"Sleepless in Seattle"?,That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --,"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?,I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
Plus he fell in love with a temp.,Listen to this, I love this part --
Hello.,Turn on your radio!
You were standing in the middle of the street?,You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
But he saw you, right?,He said hello.
It's a sign --,It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...,Okay.
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.,Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.,You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?,Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.,It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
It's probably just the flowers --,We'll move them --
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --,Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.,How amazing.
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --,Mom!
Which means --,The cabinets have to be redone --
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.,Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Who is this?,Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.,What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.,How about rapacious and love- starved?
No.,It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.,You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
You'll see.,Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
You'll like it.,This is going to be tougher than I thought.
Write her.,You think so?
It's Y. O. H.,Yeah.  What's that?
Eighty dollars.,I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?,Window.
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --,It's a spice rack.
Not.,My feelings exactly.
No, I'm not, but --,What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?,English muffin.  How do you do it?
Bye bye blackbird.,Is that what she used to sing?
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?,I don't know.
This is a good letter, Dad.,The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me",Jonah, I'm leaving --
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. ,She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
What are you doing up?,I was thirsty.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.,I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
Have you seen my wallet?,It might be in the kitchen.
You said we could go to New York.,Did not.
What if I couldn't get to you?,I was scared of what you were gonna do.
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.,Okay.
Do you like baseball?,Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.,Thanks, but... we've got plans.
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?,Microwave.  Five minutes.
You saw her in the airport and then here?,I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
How's Jonah taking it?,It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
I thought you were never going to call me.,You did?
He's ten.,He's good at it.
You're welcome to one.,No thanks.
Mornin'.,How's it going?
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.,So much the better.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.,He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?,Later. When I finish the ironing.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?,Yes. We will light the candles.
Where you going?,Got to talk to the brothers.
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.,I did forget. Lus told me.
Let them take it!,Over my dead body.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...,The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.,She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.,Can be what?
Must've been some experience for you, huh?,Yes.
Alone?,No.
Ramn -- you can't.,Why not? I'm not needed here.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.,Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?,Shut up, you're talking crazy.
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.,Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
No ...,Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
Ramn ... listen for the love of God ...,You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.,Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?,Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.,How about in the house?
What is it?,Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
Yeah.,Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
I ain't a idiot, asshole.,I'll see you tonight.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.,I understand. Thanks anyway.
Oh God.,Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
What about the guy on the very bottom?,Leave me out of this.
What do you want from me, Colette?,I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.,Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?,No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.,You always been this stubborn?
What's wrong, Danny?,Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.,I can't tell you.
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.,Why?
Colette, go.,I don't want to leave you.
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.,That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
Who is it?,It's Tom.
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?,I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.,Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
How the hell did we get this detail?,Guess it's our turn.
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.,Can you set that up?
Jimmy, where do you find these people?,The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?,Palmdale
What?,I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
But...I've seen you.,When? When did you ever see me use?
Nah... I want to keep it.  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?,Good for you Jimmy.
You want to do this some other time?,Pull your pants down.
I'm sorry?,Pull your motherfucking pants down.
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.,Big Bill
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.,What?!
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.,Please .. I don't know what you're ...
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.,God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
I was getting to it.,Tell me what?
I was trying to score some dope.,Cut the shit, Flynne.
That's because he doesn't have one.,Whata you mean?  He told me -
That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.,We got the 411 on your good old boy.
Danny?,My name is Tom.
Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this?,Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
Turns out he's connected.,To who?
The Mexicali Boys,And what does this have to do with me?
What's on the other end of this thing?,Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
What's that smell?,That would be me.
Who'd have thought it?  Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.,Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?,Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
Tom, let's spend the night here.,There's no motels around here.
You mean like the Donner Party?,Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
You think that's a good idea?,What do you mean?
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?,I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
You thinking what I'm thinking?,Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.,That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
We're in business.,Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.,Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?,No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
Resistance?,A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.,I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.,The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
Yep.,You must be a hell a shot.
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.,You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.,Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?,Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.,I'd love to hear it.
Where?,In the shadow by those two trees.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?,Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.,Good, now get your goddamned gear.
I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.,FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?,That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
Some.,Where are you from, Captain?
I wonder where they're going.,Same place we are.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?,Sure, you got one?
GO!,Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
Worked, didn't it?,You tryin' to get yourself killed?
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.,Since when have things been normal?
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?,Nope.
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.,Nope.
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?,How about I go right, sir?
You alright?,Let's just find someplace.
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?,It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.,I know.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.,I'll do my best.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.,You're welcome, John.
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.,Yes, sir.
So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.,Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?,Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.,There's to be a bright side, look for it.
I'm listening, sir.,Well, I, for one, like cheese.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!,Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?,Sure, what do you want to know?
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?,Ours is not to reason why.
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.,Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
Up.  We're moving out.,I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.,Why's that?
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.,Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.,ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.,What if our guys open up, sir?
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.,See to it.
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.,HERE THEY COME!
What deal?,I coach the baseball team, too.
Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.,Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
Don't do that again.,I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.,Struggling with a pair of Germans.
Yes, Private.,Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.,As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
I usually like surprises.,What are we likely to run into?
Damn fool.  Sir.,Captain, he's fast!
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.,He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
How do you do it?,It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...,What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
Thanks, I like yours too.,Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
Keep it.,You're sure?
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.,I hope you understand.
Gee, it's easy.,Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
Yes.,See you tomorrow.
Alright.,Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.,He wants to leave things on a good note.
I told him to be himself.,He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.
Lloyd, it's us.,Look at his face, he did the deed.
Why?,It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.,If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
I can put that together.,Confirm this with my office and my client.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?,'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!,You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
I won?,You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
Goodnight.,Goodnight.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.,I know that.
Lloyd?,Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
You're not listening to me.,Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.,Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...,No, but you stole from them.
Thank-you.  The real world.,Look at those eyes.
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.,Yeah?
Busy?,Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?,Hmmm....
Well...,No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Whoa.,Would you hold this for me?
So it's an honor?,No.
Have a good sleep.,Bye.
It's just you and your dad, right?,Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Sure I do.,Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
So what's your job this summer?,Job?  Being a great date.
Then call me tomorrow.,Today is tomorrow.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.,Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.,Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
You have to meet Bess.,Okay.
Yeah.  With potential.,Friends with potential.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...,Yeah?
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.,Oh.  I was putting the...
Are you comfortable?,Yes.  Are you shaking?
I don't think so.,You're cold.
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.,I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
I think that we should spend some time apart.,What's wrong?
It sounded like you did.,No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
Did you tell anybody?,Just my dad.
What?,I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
Okay.,Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
Yeah.,Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.
The guy with the Datsun?,No.
Okay, I'll give here the message.,Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.,Are you?
Mike Cameron, how you doing?,What?
Oh, I was just going to...,A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.,Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
Give me my firebird keys!,You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
Now you're back.,Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.,Klaus Tauber.
It's not a charade, all this?,A charade?  How could it be a charade?
What?,I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.,I'm sorry to hear that.
All right, okay, let's talk.,In Breslau.
We started without you.,Good.
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -,We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
You took my workers.,They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
You want these people.,These people, my people, I want my people.
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.,Look -
Where are the guards?,The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
What's that?,You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
So I'm responsible for the weather?,I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
What do I got for you?,Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.,You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.,That's great.
What's wrong with it?,How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
Thank you.,I need a drink.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?,Wine?
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.,Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
Jews, yeah.  Investors.,Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?,The war could end.
Don't ever do that to me again.,Do what?
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?,Christmas presents.
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.,What other point is -
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...,And killing.
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?,There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
I'll talk to him.,I think it's too late.
That's very generous of you.,Yes.
Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.,They're withholding payment.
I'll talk to you later.,No, no, what, what is it?
I can do it, Captain.,Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
You're sure about this two person thing?,Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.,thought he was doing AA.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.,I won't.
Don't. Think Bailey.,Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
Shit.,What is it?
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...,Stop it...
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.,That's too bad.
What if I said goodbye?,Why would you wanna do that?
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?,I live here.
I did that.,You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
It helped me realize one thing.,What?
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.,And much richer as a result.
And are the police sure about that?,Why don't you ask them?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?,No, I don't.
What are you going to do?,Finish what my son started.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?,No, it's not.
Two.,So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.,I really dont like that comparison, honey.
So we found a compromise.,Or it found us.
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.,I see you read the book.
This is all too familiar.,Over here.
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.,C'mon. Let's go.
Dewey?,There's nothing. I'm coming down.
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.,Yeah, right.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.,No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.,Don't worry...
I don't play games.,What if your life depended on it?
I'm sorry.,Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
What?,Oh my God.
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.,Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
That was good.,Yeah, right.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.,I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.,I'd really just like to be alone.
Can I come with her?,No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...,Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
How many guys they have on you?,I counted four.
Have they questioned you yet, Sid?,This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?,You're not allowed to ask that.
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.,But...
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.,We got free tickets.
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..,Shush.
Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?,I get scared really easy, okay.
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.,We can still Sandra Bullock it.
I'll be right back.,Where you going?
There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.,Melinda McGraw?
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.,Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Jesus.  Hello?,Hello.
What do you mean?,I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
What kind of a game?,You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
What?! But I did everything you said to do!,That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?,Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.,Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.,Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.,But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
What do you know about trilogies?,You mean like, movie trilogies?
You seem to like movies, Detective.,Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
How is that good news?,Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.,Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.,What does this have to do with Sid?
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.,Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.,Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
I can see nothing's changed.,No.
You're not a detective.,Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.,Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
Has anyone else every used your phone?,Just Jennifer.  And you.
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.,Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
Your life?,Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
No really?,There a story in that building?
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.,Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Nobody said she was an actor.,Good twist.
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.,Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?,Who?
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.,Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.,What?  What movie?
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.,SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.,I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.,You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.,The final act? Well let's play asshole!
WHERE?,I'll call you, when you're on your way.
Laura I think I just killed somebody.,Are you sure?
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?,Who the fuck is this?
What? She asked.,It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Dude. What are you doing here?,I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.,Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
Nope.,And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
Ready?,Yeah...
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?,What's that?
Jesus, SHIT!,Hey, hey, it's just me.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...,Oh Sidney...
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?,I called my dad.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.,Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.,Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
What number are you trying to reach?,I don't know.
I think you have the wrong number.,Do I?
What?,I want to talk to you for a second.
Popcorn.,You're making popcorn?
I don't know.,You have to have a favorite.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.,So, you gotta boyfriend?
Why? You wanna ask me out?,Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
What did you say?,I want to now who I'm talking to.
That's not what you said.,What do you think I said?
I have to go now.,Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Nah, I don't think so...,Don't hang up on me.
Is this some kind of a joke?,More of a game, really.
I'm two seconds from calling the police.,They'd never make it in time.
I wanna play a game.,No...
What's his name?,I can't think.
Now for the real question.,NOOOO....
But you're doing so well.,Please go away! Leave us alone!
...please... no...,Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
What door am I at?,What?
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.,I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?,Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
What brings you out to these parts?,You never know when or where a story will break.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.,Can I bring Kenny?
So is Dewey your real name?,Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.,Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
Any word on my Dad?,Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.,Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
She's tough.,Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?,She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.,Yes, sir.
Jesus...,What is it? Where's Casey?
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.,When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
You owe my mother.,Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.,What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
Many times.,Has his story changed?
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?,And why would she do that?
Where do you get this shit?,Ricki Lake.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.,And why is that?
Hello?,Hello Sidney.
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.,LEAVEMEALONE!
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?,She's the Scream Queen.
You coming tonight?,Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.,The why'd the police let him go?
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.,And what would be your motive?
What's Leatherface doing here?,He came to make up.
There goes my chance with Sid.,Like you had one.
Why are they doing this?,Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.,Are you serious?
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.,No way.
Tell your mom I said thanks.,Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.,I'm not worried.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.,Whatever. Just hurry.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.,Just like old times, ain't it?
Take a message.,It's alright. I'll get it.
Shit, what is he doing here?,I bet he's pissed.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?,I don't know...
Who?,Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?,Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
It's none of my business anymore.,I thought you might want to be filled in.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.,Yeah.
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.,Who tied her down?  You or him?
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!,Turn around.  Hands on your head!
What the hell's going on?,Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
Where we headed?,You'll see.
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.,Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...,Spit it out.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.,You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
A woman...,Murderers like you?
You should be thanking me.,And, why is that?
You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.,We would have gotten you eventually.
You've made a good life for yourself...,Shut up!
Here he comes.,What the fuck is going on?
You just met me.,Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.,I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
There's a bucket here.,What?
This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.,This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
It's too soon for him.,Can we talk about this in private?
I'd like you to meet Somerset.,Hello.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.,All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
He must have left another puzzle piece.,Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.,And, if it's a threat.
Seven Terraces of Purgation.,Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.,Forced what?
No fingerprints?,Nothing.
No witnesses of any kind?,None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
This is the one thing.,I know.
You're sure your men didn't move this?,Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
Nothing.,It's got to be.
He just may be nuts enough.,It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...,Oh, that's all.
I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.,I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
You tell me.  I'm new in town.,He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.,No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.,What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.,How is this legal?
You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?,That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
What are you going to say?,You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
Wait... just wait.,It was him.
You stupid son of a...,No point in arguing anymore...
No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  It's just his mind poured out on paper.  I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.,Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.,Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.,You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
Tell me it's not true.,I can't let you do this...
I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.,High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
I don't know why I asked you to come.,Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.,He mentioned it.
What you saw wasn't Lucy.,It was, I tell you!
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...,What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
You all right, sergeant?,Dunno...Seems so.
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.,How far's the river from here, Mose?
I didn't give any order to fire!,That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.,How many, would you say?
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.,Now mount up, son...
I say NO!,Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
Told ya, didn't I?,Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
How'd you come by this?,You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
Talk!,A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
And maybe you lie...,In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...,Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
What you want me to call you?,Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...,YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...,I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!,I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...,Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...,Cut it out, will ya...
Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...,She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
Think she means for us to follow?,How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
I think maybe we oughta...,Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
No...She's not...,I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
Stay out here.,Not likely.
Why it's just a snip of calico...,You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...,From the beginning...
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...,Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
Don't go takin' that stuff...,Ain't worth the mendin'...
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?,Well I ain't one of 'em!
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!,Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
But couldn't you...?,Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
Ellen, move aside...,Oh God, Tommi...
Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.,We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Where are you going?,Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?,I just had a really strange experience.
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.,Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?,Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
Who was that?,Someone from the village.
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.,No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?,Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?,Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
She was old.,Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
Ellen Straub.,It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.,Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
Mrs. Straub!,I've killed my husband!
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.,Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
Twenty-three, to be exact.,I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
NedI knowI know,It's good.
You are a gentleman.,And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
I know your face. Are you an actor?,Yes.
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.,Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!,You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
We will all be put in the clink.,See you in jail.
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and,Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
And your relations?,On my mother's side the Ardens
So now you are free to love,yet cannot love nor write it.
Will it restore my gift?,The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.,That's me.
When?,Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!,Partners!
The theatres are all closed by the plague!,Oh, that.
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?,It is all locked safe in here
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -,What piece? Richard Crookback?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.,Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.,Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?,I did not.
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?,Tomorrow
Romeo.,The one who came with your letter?
By God, I wish I knew.,By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
The show must  you know,Go on.
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.,Good title.
The daughter of his enemy.,The daughter of his enemy.
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.,Mercutiogood name.
This is a different one.,A different one you haven't written?
"Good morrow, cousin.","Is the day so young?"
Not ready? Where is she?,Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?,Be still.
Like Valentine and Silvia?,No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
Your mother, and your father,From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
He looks well enough for a mountebank.,Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
Your Majesty!,Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?,I have lost my gift.
But your voice  Have they dropped?,No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.,Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.,My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.,I have to get back.
Oh my lady, my love!,If they find you here they will kill you.
I do not know how to undress a man.,It is strange to me, too.
Even your play.,Oh
And that was only my first try.,Well perhaps better than my first. 
Oh, do not go,I must. I must
Oh, Will!,Yes, some of it is speakable.
"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?",That's my line!
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.,Oh, but it will end well for love?
Then I will go with you.,You cannot, Wessex will kill you
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.,My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
Will you read it for me?,"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.,Nor you for me.
My lady Viola.,My lord.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.,Do you intend to marry, my lord?
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.,Virginia?!
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.,I will do my duty, my lord.
Good morning, my lord!,Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.,Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
Wait there.,Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
No, sir.,He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.,Of course you have not! I have not written it!
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?,I  Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Your aunt?,Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
And her lips?,Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!,You are on my ground.
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?,Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.,Serve.
I was trying to educate you.,Just serve.
About this guy, this Hugo person.,I don't have time.
No.,Think about it.
He's still here.,He couldn't get his car started.
I can't do it.,I don't hear this.
How much?,I don't know.
What is this?,Security.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?,There was a break-in.
Doesn't it worry you?,No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.,I don't know anything about it.
Well?,But there's no --
I don't know them.,And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
That's it, then.,That's all?
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?,Yes.
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.,Well, yes.
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?,I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?,OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
I'm not usually drunk.,Not usually this drunk.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --,It was you, Juliet, it was you --
-- which is --,-- which is a hack.
The man we know and love.,A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
Know and love?,Yeah.
You see, they don't really know me.,No, Alex, we don't really love you.
Have you seen Hugo?,No. Any idea which channel he's on?
Maybe he didn't like us.,David?
Hugo.,His car's still there.
Now?,Yes.
I don't thinkI can.,But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
Hello. Hello.,Who was it?
No.,Then let's spend some money.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?,No, no, it's different.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.,Be like a weight off your shoulders.
You know we're right.,Don't you?
Leave him alone.,He can't stay up there.
Later. But first -- him.,David?
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.,It's the only way.
What?,As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Are you all right?,Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
It makes us feel a whole lot better.,That's what I thought he said.
You mustn't take it so badly.,Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.,Let him go. Let him take it all.
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.,did you hear anything before he cries?
I see.,I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
I've never seen a dead body before.,Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Two hundred pounds.,You paid two hundred pounds for this?
That's what it cost, David.,No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.,Yes, sir.
What do you do?,Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
What's it about?,A priest who dies.
I see.,Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
It was some guy called Brian.,Did he sound upset?
Sorry?,And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
Both, sir.,Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
I don't know, I think...,Look, would you argue with your doctor?
Do you think George is a fairy?,Who?
That's George.,It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.,What do you expect me to do about it?
-- is that right?,-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?,No.
Thanks a lot.,Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
What?,These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
I know.,Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
She did?,It turned out to be cancer.
You're late, George.,I gotta talk to you.
Nummers.,What?
-- to be put in that kind of position...,I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
-- Anyway.,I hope she's all right.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?,I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
Are you?,No.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.,Okay.
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.,No thanks.
C'mon, are you or aren't you?,Gee, this is great.
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.,Why do you wanna know so bad?
What?,You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
Yeah...,Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
So you want to go in business for yourself?,Right.
And you need money?,Right, that's right.
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.,They are?
Pardon me?,Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
Yes, Buffums.,I've got heads here, Norman.
You're late, George.,Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
What!,Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
How long you had this?,Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
Well, what do you think?,I'd cut it...
You don't seem very sure.,No, I'm sure.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.,Yeah... wow.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.,Do you? You still see him?
Why not?,... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
George...,I just have to do one little thing.
You know what I'm talking about.,Hey, I don't tell.
It'll ruin everything.,I know... you don't know, I know.
Sit down.,What are you talking about?
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...,-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
Don't do it.,That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
-- gee...,-- what?
Where do you want to go?,Sammy's?
What are you looking at?,The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
Am I entertaining you?,We're friends.
-- ass and legs --,Look who's talking.
Where are you going?,Please, we'll have to talk later --
Well then what are you trying to do-,I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.,What's that supposed to mean?
-- Right after I sprayed her?,What?
Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?,Wanda...
Yeah?...,She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
Yeah!,Wash her.
What with?,-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
-- White ladies?,-- Oh my yes.
-- you shouldn't do me like that...,-- please, please forgive me...
-- took a bus.,-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
-- yes, George.,I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.,That's too bad.
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.,Great, great. I hope you make it.
George --,Keep moving --
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.,What?
Honey?,Yeah, baby.
But in the same house, you know, one house.,-- Sure.
Yeah.,Okay...  Night, baby.
George?,What!
George.,Hey, baby, what's happening?
Yeah, baby...,How did it go at the bank?
George.,Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
No, but I think they might.,Just a second, I'll be right with you...
What do you want?,Your advice!
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!,Neither do I, baby.
Jill says nothing.,Where's your car?
A friend dropped me off.,Who?
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.,Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
Now, Jackie --,-- she's a very compulsive girl.
-- well aren't you --,-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.,Oh, Christ.
Baby, don't do this --,-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
-- please, baby --,-- no, it'll help me, really --
... well I'm glad you told me.,Jesus.
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.,After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --,I don't know what to...
Godammit, George...,Now wait a minute...
I wanna hear about it, George.,Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
Why, why do you think that is?,Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
You really think so?,Yes I do.
,No.
Come on by.,I'll call you back...
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.,How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.,George is going to open a shop.
You're lying about one thing, Lester.,What's that?
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.,Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Who are they?,Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?,I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
That's right.,I'll call you.
I am? I mean why?,Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?,George is great but I know what you mean.
I thought you said things were great with George.,Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
-- Yeah, honey...,I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...,Didn't you have any panties on?
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.,No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
... my friend doesn't like it here either.,All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.,-- sort of a boyfriend?
Good for you.,He's a hairdresser.
-- so when are you going to Egypt?,You mean when are you going to Egypt?
You're going?,You're going.
You're kidding.,Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
-- I'll get in the back --,-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?,Jill.
Are you married?,No.
No of course not.,-- we're going to be here all night.
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?,French Fries and Ketchup.
I don't know.,Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Room 237?,You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
Yeah, I guess so.,What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?,Okay, Mom.
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?,Okay...oh!
It's so pretty.,Yeah.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?,No.
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.,I won't, Mom.
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?,Okay, Mom.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!,Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
To my stomach.,Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
But eh what was the matter with him?,Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?,Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
Oh I wouldn't think of it.,Well how can I repay you?
Grady?,Yes, sir.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.,Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
Good evening.  Forest Service.,Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.,It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
No, we don't mind.,Good.
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.,Thank you for saying so.
Hi, babe.,Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.,Uh...huh.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.,What time is it?
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.,Hmm, nice.
I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.,Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?,Yes.
Somebody did that to him.,I think he did it to himself.
Get him out of here?,Yes.
You mean just leave the hotel?,Yes.
I...,I can't really remember.
As soon as possible.,Jack...
Stay away from me!  Please...,Stop swinging the bat.
Stay away from me.,Give me the bat.
I'll bring back a doctor.,Wendy...
I'm gonna go now.,Wendy...
Very nice to meet you.,Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
Only in a very general way.,Well...
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.,Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are,shut in together over long periods of time.
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.,Well, it's very... homely.
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.,Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.,Oh, I'll say.
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.,Fine.
What time does the plane leave?,Eight thirty.
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.,Fine.
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!,Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
Went shopping. Why?,Jane, I have to talk to you.
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!,Jane-
There's something else scary.,What?
I've been hearing noises in there.,What kind of noises?
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.,Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.,Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?,A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.,And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.,I don't get you.
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.,Yeah, I know. It's great!
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?,Yeah... sure.
What is it?,A tracer. You'll like it.
Was it a prescription?,What the hell does that matter?
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.,Marty, do you see your suspect?
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.,The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
Yeah? Really?,Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.,See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
Really.,Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?,What about crack?  You a user?
I think I hear it!,LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
SING!,Were you tempted?
And I'm tearful!,SING!
Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.,And you listen to that?
His ashes?,With love.
What?,You can handle this.
Okay, Christy -- strip.,What?
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?,I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!,That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
Oh, girls.,Yes, Betty?
This prom is a real drag.,Oh-huh.
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?,Just about.  Show me again.
What?,You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.,Mary Robert.
Hopeless I,Amateurs 2
Is there any syrup?,Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.,That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
It's after five.  We have to bathe.,Five a.m.?
A cigarette?,An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.,She said that?  Reverend Mother?
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.,Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...,Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
Are you leaving us?,Oh no.  We'll always be together.
The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?,Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME,What did He say?
That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.,Very well.
The reason?,Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
Sit down.,What?
And all those like you.,You mean black people?
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.,What's a concubine?
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...,No problem.
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.,I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.,Mary Clarence!
It never solves anything.,Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.,I am?
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.,Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.,Out of the question.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?,I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
But... wait a minute...,The majority has spoken.
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.,Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?,You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.,Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?,Don't push it.
He's a businessman.,A what? When are you qonna wake up?
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?,Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.,He didn't do you a favor.
I hate you.  I totally hate you.,Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here?
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.,I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!,Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?,Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!,What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.,You're supposed to be hiding out!
I am?,Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
Really?  Lieutenant?,I've been worried about you.
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.,You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.,I think they'd understand.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.,Really.
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.,Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
We're looking for Mike.,You found him -- but we're not open yet.
And if she runs?,Take care of it.
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?,It didn't happen.
Well?,It didn't work, Vince.
Get her!,Which one!
I can't see anything in here!,Willy -- hit the lights.
Joey?,Where is she?
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.,No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?,Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.,Really...
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.,All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?,A Benedictine.
Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?,She said they were from her old convent.
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.,And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
We both missed.,Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
Who took the meat?,Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
Hail, Constable.  How are you?,Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.,How did you hear this?
What the hell are you doing?,You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
They spend two days in chains.,Two days... ?  For murder?
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.,I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
No bleeding.,What is that?
We must be a curious sight to him.,What are you spying on?
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.,Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.,No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.,Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.,Chosen me?
Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.,More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
What is the common thread between these victims?,I'm sure I don't know.
Where are we going?,Up.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.,You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?,We should go.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.,And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
Why... why are you like this?,You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
Climb up!,Lady Van Tassel...
What can we do?,Take the reins.
Other people?,Small talk.
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...,You made this, and the drawings?
Thank you.  No.  Here...,I insist that you have it.
What are you on about?,The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
She is not your birth mother, is she?,No, but... why do you ask that?
What are you doing?,Just... keep where you are.
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?,The skull is gone.
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.,It was you there?
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.,What would you have me believe?
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?,It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
Where?,She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
It appears well.  It has already clotted.,Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
I know you saw me.,What... ?
You cannot kill what is already dead.,Let her go!
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...,To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
What... what are you doing?,Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.,No one will believe your lies, whore.
She has confessed.,No.
There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too."  Get it? That's a goodun.,Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.,Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
All right then.,I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?,No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.,He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
Well, what did you want?,You have any biscuits for sale?
Did you decide, sir?,What you got that's good to eat?
Well, I guess it's all good.,What do you like to eat here?
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.,What you got in there, warshing?
Yeah.,Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
About a half a mile I think it is.,I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.,No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.,This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
Leave.,Don't tell me what to do.
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.,He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.,I get nervous, that's all I know.
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.,I know Albert. We're friends.
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.,Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
What's in your bag?,This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?,Childers.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.,I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
Why'd you live there?,I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
They let you out?,Yeah.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?,You told me to come by.
Did you want to play ball with us?,I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.,I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
How did your mama die?,You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.,Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
Were they bad people?,I thought they was.
Hey Karl, you off work?,Yeah.
So it died when it come out?,My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.,Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
Can we play ever' Saturday?,If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
Yeah, I guess.,Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.,I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.,You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
Yes sir.,I've got a feelin' today.
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.,Okay.
Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.,Nice to meet you, Karl.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?,Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?,No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.,I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.,We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
I ain't got nothing but them books.,You better go get 'em.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?,I reckon.
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?,Yes sir.
I'll be.,That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?,Right now?
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.,Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?,I could shore use some. Thank ye.
We sure like havin' you.,Thank ye.  I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?,I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Quite a spell, I reckon.,Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.,I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.,I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
Okay.,This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?,That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?,I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.,He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.,Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Let's just go, Marsha.,No, we have to get this story.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.,Why won't he talk to women?
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?,Yes sir.
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.,Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?,I knew he slept in a toolshed.
Is he leaving right this minute?,We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
Where will he go?,Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Will he be supervised?,As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.,You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.,Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
What!,Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
No! At least I don't think I am!,Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
And what's the occasion of this celebration?,It's my birthday.
And what are you, his chaperone?,Actually, I'm his father.
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?,Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?,Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Not an easy book.,Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
What happened?,I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.,Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.,I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Do me a favor, will you?,What's that, Sol?
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.,The Queen of England?
I'd like to see your pictures some day.,It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?,Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.,Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
The kid's sorry, Auggie.,Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.,If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
No, he's not. You are.,You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?,Not a peep.
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.,That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.,Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?,You got it.
I'm all ears.,Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.,Anything for art, eh, Paul?
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?,Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?,Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.,It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.,Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.,I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.,And what's that supposed to mean?
Still, you can't just write her off.,Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
No you're not.,Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.,Bully for you.
There's just one thing I want to know.,Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?,I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.,I almost got married once.
Lovely.,She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.,They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.,Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.,What difference does it make?
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?,Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
It'll never be finished.,Huh?
Does it hurt?,Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.,Thanks for the tip.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?,That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.,It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?,Just passing through.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.,It'll cost you five bucks.
The name is Cyrus Cole.,Paul. Paul Benjamin.
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.,And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Hi there, little brother.,Say hi to Paul.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.,Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.,Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.,Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.,I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.,I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.,I owe you something.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.,Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.,Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
Of course. Where else?,Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.,You can't be more specific than that?
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.,But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.,What time is it?
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?,I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?,No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
Where did you get that thing?,I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
And?,I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.,Why don't you go to the police?
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.,It looks like they've met in this apartment.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.,Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?,Absolutely. We would be honored.
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.,His only copy?
Hi, kid.,Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...,Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
Now, Mister Gi...,Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
Happy for him.  And relieved.,So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
Closer to eight.,So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.,It seems human.  To me.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.,At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.,So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?,Oh, in a heartbeat.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?,Pretty darn clear.
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.,Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?,My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
Yes.  Initially.,Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.,Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?,I have told the truth.
You have the night watch?  On the radio.,Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.,That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
That's when he fell.,Fell.
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...,He hit his head.  On the way in.
You think so?,The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
You always run with the well open?,I was checking the cables.
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.,Naw, I had that around for a while.
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.,Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.,I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?,It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.,He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
What else could it be?,Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?,I can't speak for him.
Okay, doll.,I suppose you want a tip?
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.,Thank you ever so.
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?,It's private.  Go away.
Okay. ,Manhattans?  This time of night?
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.,Those two musicians from the garage!
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -,How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
You're going to bet my money on a dog?,He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?,Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
Yeah - where were you?,With you.
Nellie told us about it.,We're not too late, are we?
No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.,But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
You've flipped your wig!,Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
My name is Josephine.,And I'm Daphne.
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -,Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!
Done what?,Tore off one of my chests.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!,You tore it again!
Blow where?,You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.,Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
You know - the old shell game.,Daphne, you're bothering us.
I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?,Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
Oh, he does!,Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
And where's he going to be?,He's going to be ashore with you.
With ME?,That's right.
What happened?,I'm engaged.
WHAT?,Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
Jerry!  You can't be serious!,Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?,Security.
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?,We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
Hey - these are real diamonds.,Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
Not that, you idiot.,But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?,What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?,Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.,No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?,We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
All right - so what do we do now?,First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
What'll I tell him?,Tell him you're going to elope with him.
OH!,Terribly sorry.
Are my seams straight?,I'll say.
Oh - Sugar!,I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
I'm not crowding you, am I?,No.  It's nice and cozy.
I'm a very sick girl.,Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
You all right?,I'm fine.
How's the bottle?,Half-full.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.,I may spill something.
We better have a drink first.,Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
I'll carry the instruments.,Thank you, Daphne.
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.,You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.,Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
I'm a what?,Or was it Bryn Mawr?
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.,If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.,I hope so.
No!,Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.,I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
What for?,And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
How did those holes get there?,Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?,Yes.  For a whole year.
I was it.,What's the big idea?
It's about the Florida job.,The Florida job?
Yes, I'm holding on.,Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.,I am Cinderella the Second.
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?,Most of the time I slap it.
You're leading again.,Sorry.
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.,Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
Why not?,Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
I don't care.,And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
I don't like no witnesses.,We won't breathe a word.
You're making it up pretty good so far.,The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?,Why?
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?,No - funerals.
We got it second-hand.,All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
Rough?,I'll say.
Bingo?,You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
Yeah.,You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
You don't say?,Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.,You're entitled.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.,Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Happy days.,I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.,She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?,Not very likely.
Your face is familiar.,Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
Yeah.  Real hot.,Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -,- Inauguration balls -
Shell Oil?,Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
Well, I guess I'd better go -,It's been delightful meeting you both.
And you will come to hear us tonight?,If it's at all possible -
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?,Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.,Looks like they're on the wrong track.
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.,It's all right for a bachelor.
What a beautiful fish.,Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?,They shrink when they're marinated.
Champagne?,I don't mind if I do.
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.,Bon voyage.
Look at all that silverware.,Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?,I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Where's your shell collection?,Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
Would you do me a favor?,What is it?
Anything this time?,I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Well - ?,I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.
I never knew it could be like this.,Thank you.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?,Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.,Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?,Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.,That's because I've been on the wagon.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.,Me?  I'm just a customer here.
Thanks, Charlie.,If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.,Goodbye, Charlie.
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.,Why wouldn't I?
I dont think I can go through with this.,Pub Golf?
Hey.,Hey.
You know what? Im not having this conversation right now.,Sure, disappear. Weve been walking away our whole lives.
It was such a long time ago.,Still--
Whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?,Um, just about everyone.
You heading to the train station?,I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
Whats his problem?,What?
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.,Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
Ah, a philosopher.,Shrink, actually.
Crikey.,What?
Nothing, nothing.,No, tell me.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.,Hello, Katmandu.
Hey, Kat.,Hey, yourself.  I see youve met my ex.
So, tell me, hows unmarried life?,I have regrets.
So, whats your point?,I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
Im sorry?,I shagged Amy. Two years ago. Thats why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?,Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in share. People do that.
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macram.,He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.
What did he say exactly? I mean, you dont think he wants me back?,I dont know.
What does your gut say?,Youre too good for him.
That wont be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.,Its okay. Hell, Ive never paid for it. But please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
You quitting?,Im desperate to start but I dont have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I cant get enough of.
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.,Oh, no.
Yes.,What?!
So youre telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? Thats a down payment on a Ford Focus!,Not dollars. Pounds.
And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?,No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. Its all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, youre not walking away!,Oh, cut the crap!
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. Its your job. Its who you are. How would you even know if something were real?,Youre judging me?! Oh, thats a good one. Youre lying to me, youre lying to your family, and youre lying to yourself. But youre going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
You pawned it.,Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
You want I nut him in the boat?,Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
Im worried. Amys not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it drunker or drunker-er?,Just drunk enough.
I always wondered what happened with us.,I havent thought about that in years.
Im guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.,Is there any other way to take it?
Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--,--and The ass of The man who adores her.
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.,You don't live around here, do you?
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.,Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?,Sometime, but not like this.
They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.,Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?
And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?,Colored.
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.,What's his name?
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. ,What he talk 'bout?
... So me and Sounder, ran right by the men that was the prisoners, and crawled under the fence! That's when I cut my hand on the glass. It hurt like mad! But I kept runnin', and then I didn't feel no more hurtin' till I stopped runnin'!  Why was that, Miss Johnson?,Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.,You could? How?
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?,Yes, Miss Johnson...
Go on...,Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
:--THE STRANGE ENDINGS OF NATURE THEY HAVE SEEN, MAY GIVE THE WORLD NEW POINTS OF VIEW AND MAKE THEIR LOVING, LIVING, AND DOING PRECIOUS TO ALL HUMAN...,:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...,:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!,You would do that, wouldn't you?
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.,Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.,They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?,Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
You bet we is!,I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
You hurt, Daddy!?,No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
You know somethin', Daddy?,What's that, son?
Mister, can you visit anybody here?,Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
When's that?,Sunday...
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.,I don't look like no possum!
Who's winning, Mama?,Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!,David, come back here!
Did you see Daddy?,No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
What is it, David Lee?,Listen, Mama...
Poor creature...,He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!,Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.,I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
What's that you carryin'?,Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
So when I left, she gave me these books.,Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
This is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.,Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
When you read it we'll talk about it...,Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Would you like to have a cool drink, David?,No, thank you -- I gotta go do some work in the field today.
Come, I'll take you home.,I'll walk...
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.,I'm used to it.
Well, let me have it.,Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.,I brought these walnuts to trade.
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--,I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
Whatcha wanta order?,I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.,What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
Good mornin', Nathan.,Mornin'...
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!,Ike, you could make a song outta that!
But, Nathan--,Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.,You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.,There are more important matters right now...
NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!,Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
To free Terrance and Phillip.,But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
<b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>,But what are we going to do against this entire army?
Dude, how can you hate the environment?,'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
Come on, just get to the message board!,I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
Bingo. Okay, here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...,Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
Mph rmpmh rm.,No way.
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?,Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!,I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
You've got a stupid accent too.,Eric, that is not appropriate.
Mkay.,God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?,Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
Thank God, that sucked ass.,Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
Hello there, children!!,Hey, Chef.
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?,It's... It's not good children.
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!,This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
Ber dada!,Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
What are you doing?! Get on with your misery!,Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!,Dude, what the hell is going on?
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?,No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!,We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!,YOU BASTARD!!
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!,You bastards!!
How can they do this?,It isn't fair!
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?,I don't know, dude.
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!,Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
WHAT?,Are you sure, Kenny?
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.,Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.,Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!,We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
Shiteater-,-Or monkey fucker-
And Bill?,Yes?
Hello, Conan!,Hello, Brooke Shields!
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.,I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!,You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!,Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
You know I do.,I know.
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.,I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>,<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!,Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
Ow, you're hurting me!,Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
Yeah!,This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
NAZIS!!,What's the matter, Wendy?
Wendy?,Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?,Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
What is it?,Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
Check.,And the butfor?
Oh my God, what is he doing?,He's shutting off the air!!!
Getting drunk is no solution.,Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
Oh yeah...,Oh Sara...
Weren't you down in the dining room?,I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
On channel 10?,The device has stopped responding.
All too well, captain.,Well shut it off at once!
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.,Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.,Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
You gotta think of your old age.,That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
If anyone can hear me please respond!,That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!,Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.,We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?,I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.,Like that piece of ass he was with.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?,Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.,Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?,It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?,With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
OK...it's open.,Seen one like it before?
And suppose you couldn't hold out?,Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
He certainly is polite.,Close every door behind you!
You're ready for the real thing?,At this point I'm ready for anything.
Explosive?,One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
Dawn!  Dawn!,Helllp!
Oh my God.  What happened?,The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
Sooner than later.,Over and out.
What do you mean?  What happened!,We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
In that case, I accept.,Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
What is it?!,I don't know.  Wave to them!
No, just enjoying the view.,Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
So I've been told.,Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
What is happening around here!!!,There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...,Send it back if you don't want it.
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!,Talk to him...Jesus...
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?,Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?,Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
Is it safe for human transport?,That's affirmative.
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.,My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
You a mini-golfer?,Nope.
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?,Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.,It belonged to my dad.
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?,He's my dad.
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.,You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?,No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
Three whips. To go.,When you get a chance.
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.,La da da dalala...
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no ,gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
Think he bought it?,I'd buy it!
It's a beautiful thing.,A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.
Need some advice, huh.,Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.,That game was before you was born.
Who gave it to you?,Grace Skinner.
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.,I got a right. You're my father.
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.,You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.,Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.,Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.,I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.,You got a better offer?
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.,I couldn't care less.
The whole world thinks you're underground.,I am underground.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!,Clam it!
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.,Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
My poor baby!,You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?,I found dad.
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.,Who's there?
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.,He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.,Who's there?
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.,It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.,If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.,You know who I am?
Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top. ,Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.,Why would you help me?
Don't go near the bowling alley.,Bowling "Center"!
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!,Yippy!
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?,Who wants to know?  Zeus!
I'm a bowler.,I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.,He's my father, Millie.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.,Where can I find him?
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.,I'm not here to - I can't...
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.,Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
This is a vicious cycle.,I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
Whoa.,It's a vicious cycle.
Can I ask you something personal?,I'd rather you didn't.
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.,No, I'm fascinated.
Why were you suspended?,I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
What's plan B?,Plan B is your dad.
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.,He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.,I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
Then it's true, isn't it? About...,...lane six. Yes.
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?,Nope, I couldn't care less.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.,It's Junior, isn't it.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.,He's my father.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.,Did you - kill him?
Where are you going?,I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
Can I come with you?,I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
Why did you come back?,When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.,I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?,I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
Very professional.,I am a professional man.
Lips still for sale?,You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.,Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
How big is this spacecraft?,Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
Norman!,Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
Direction's east coming!,What was that?
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?,Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?,Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.,Geologists?
Maybe older --,-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.,It doesn't make any sense.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.,ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
What is it, Norman?,Take a look.
Picked up something?  What is it?,I don't know.  But it's something alien.
Harry's missing.,What do you mean, he's missing?
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.,He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!
I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.,How drastic?
You don't want to know.,I think I do.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.,She should've known better.
Wait a second --,-- and then brought her down here --
You don't think weapons are important?,I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
Edmunds?,Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
Going active.,Jerry?
Yes, sir.  I'm here.,You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
Can you open that panel?,Working on it now, sir.
It's not sucking, sir.,Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?,I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
It's chipped.,Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
I did.,Then how can it be chipped?
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.,The what?
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.,It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
You don't know that.,Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.,What's the message?
I have to tell you.  It's strange.,How do you mean, strange?
Some sort of lead or something.,Radiation shield, you think?
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.,What?  No, I know they're civilians...
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.,Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?,I love secrets.
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.,That's quite a secret.
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.,C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.,It never occurred to me.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?,The timing has never seemed quite right.
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.,What -- are you threatening me?
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?,Yeah.  Drowning.
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.,My gosh, Norman.
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?,Yeah, why?
Norman.,What are they?
Beth --,You did, didn't you?
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.,Beth --
Forget the sub.,Don't bother me, Norman.
It's not worth the risk.,It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
You, me and Harry?,You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.,My air isn't... I'm coming back.
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.,What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
You get it straightened out?,I think so, Beth.  Yes.
Wait a second --,1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.,This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
Page 87.,What?
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.,What do you mean, a part of Harry?
It's for motion sickness.,Valdomet.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?,Antibiotic.
Not believing you.,You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
What's wrong, Norman?,I'm feeling better.
You don't think I put something in it, do you?,You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
He can't manifest.,No, he can't.
You're lying --,Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
That's when you went in the sphere.,One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
That's bullshit.,Is it?
Shut up, Beth --,When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.,Don't fuck with me, Beth.
You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.,I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.,C'mon --
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?,That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.,Another attack?
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.,We can refuse to talk.
When did it come across?,Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
Where's it coming from?,No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
Don't be defensive.,I'm not being defensive.
Go ahead.  Ladies first.,No, why don't --
C'mon.,Wait a second, I --
This answers one of our questions.,Which one?  Let me get the list out.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.,Am I?
Norman?,What is it, Harry?
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?,Page 87 of what, Harry?
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.,That far in what, Harry?
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.,Did I?
... you there?  Norman?,Harry?
Norman, where are you?,I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
What is it?,You know what it is, Harry.
Fine.,Help me lift her.
I can't reach her.,Hold on.
How's that working out, by the way?,Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
What does Norman already know?,Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
She told me what you said, Norman.,What is it, Harry?
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.,But it's impossible.
All the facts you need are right in front of you.,Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Do you?,If it is an alien spacecraft --
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.,It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.,Meaning?
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.,Arrived?  From where?
What'd you say?,"We are friends".
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...,What was that, sir?
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?,No, they didn't say --
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.,Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.,Who's everyone?
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.,You mean a picture?
Try this one.,This is like nursery school.
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?,Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
What was it?,Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?,I'm not sure.
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?,Don't be so supportive, honey.
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.,Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.,Is that good or bad?
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.,We'll be back before you are, old man.
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?,I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.,I know that.
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!,Could I learn to feel it?
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.,What do you mean?
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.,How can you store an energy field within you?
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?,Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.,You mean we should go after her!...
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.,Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!,But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Have you been checked out?,Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
Here come six more... grid two!,Was this trip really necessary?
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.,Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.,We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
I found it... It's just not there.,What are you saying?
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...,Why?
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.,Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
No!...,It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.,Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?,That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...,If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.,No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?,Something... I've got...you don't.
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.,Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...,Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Mobile Infantery rules !,Death to all bugs !
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...,He was our teacher... He was great.
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?,Sir, no, sir.
Yeah, but I want Carmen.,You got it bad.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.,Your father will never let you.
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.,The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?,I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
You always told me you couldn't do human...,I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
Are you alright ?,I'm getting better.
I'm all ears.,Don't you have to finish the game ?
Johnny, this is Zander.,Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?,Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.,Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
Profile's wrong... there.,No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...,Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?,Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
I'm sorry, Carmen.,Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
Good for you.,Your turn...
She's flying starships !,Who ?
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...,Excuse me...!
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?,How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !,It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?,Yeah, sure, I guess.
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...,Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
What happened to your hair ?,What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
What's wrong with you ?,Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
...I'm sorry.,We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.,What happened to your eye ?
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.,I like it. It's kinda...you.
Take care, wilya Johnny ?,See you on the bounce !
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.,Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.,Yes, ma'am.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.,Thank you, ma'am.
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.,Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!,Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Report.,Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...
Where'd it come from ?,Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!,That's it, we're empty ma'am !
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.,Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
You used to dance...,I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !,Teenagers !
...CUT OFF !,Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
Mr. Rasczak.,Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.,Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !,I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?,Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?,Here in Buenos Aires.
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...,I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !,This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
Don't be a hero...,This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.,Yes, sir.
AAAAAAAAAAAA !,Cover us, Ace !
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...,We're not leaving you here, sir !
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?,To join with him.
The Creator is that which created V'ger.,Who is V'ger?
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?,Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?,By the Creator.
Departure angle on viewer.,Departure angle.
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.,Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?,Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.,No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?,Mr Decker....
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.,How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!,Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.,They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.,Captain... I'd like to go along...
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.,It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
Forward motion, Captain...!,A tractor beam...
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. ,   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.,You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
Was he difficult?,No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?,If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!,I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!,Ten seconds....
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...,Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.,Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.,Aye, sir.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.,We're already two settings below that, sir.
One hundred kilometers...,Hold relative position here...
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...,Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.,I want him here.  Sit down!
I still contain fragments of my human half.,And whatever you sensed out here....
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.,Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
What answers?,'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
Child...!?,Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
Not for us?,No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...,That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.,To you, sir?
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...,Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?,We're ready, sir.
Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...,Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
Go you Huskies?,You bet your life.
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.,Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
The people in New Hampshire.,That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
I quit.,You quit.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.,It's in your play.
You like my play.,Yes.
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.,It's about a man who gets a second chance.
I...,No, of course, you want to get out of town.
You get what you pay for.,That's true.  You grow up here?
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.,Yes...
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...,No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...,Yes...
...who...?,Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?,You're still here.
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?,Well, first, you got to change the title...
What I need to <u>say</u>...,<u>Yes</u>...
About <u>conflict</u>...,That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...,What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...,...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
What happened?,Cast stood me up.
...lost the screw...,You got a paperclip?
You like kids?,Never saw the point of 'em.
It's for your finger.,One moment.
Hi.,You going to ask me in?
Later on.,Then I'll come back, then.
You can do it.,Because I'd met someone else.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?,Sure did.
What's the scene...,It used to be the Old Mill.
What've you got?,They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.,...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
No, that's true.,No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
What would you do with it, the printshop...,Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
Press still works.,It does?
That's something a man could do...?,You know what else a man can do?
Yeah, you?,Oh yeah.
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...,Yes...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?,...the better to eat me with, your dear?
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.,Not without a rolltop desk.
Lookit that, up already.,That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...,Carla was in the car, right?
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...,Water or mineral deposits.
We on for tomorrow night?,After Drama Group.
Drama Group?,Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
I'm sorry.,Why, you <u>whore</u>!
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?,Hi.
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...,Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
They're holding it for ransom.,Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
It'll hurt the box office.,They know what her tits look like.
He's on the ph...,Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.,Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.,This horse is booked.
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.,Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...,Uh, <u>look</u>....
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...,...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
Whyn't you learn your lines?,I <u>know</u> my lines...
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...,No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
Mornin, sister.,We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?,Sure, what have you got?
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.,I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
What else?,Page...<u>three</u>.  Now:  "It's a nice evening."  I'm not gonna say that... "It's a nice..."
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...,We've got three days to...

I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat.  <u>My</u> thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that.  Now:  what is this you want <u>Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars</u> to do what you're being paid to, you already <u>signed</u> you'd do...?  What is that?,I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...

My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...,You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?

You lost Ben?!,Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!

I hate her.  I really hate her.,There you are!
...your hating me.,Cos she loves you.
Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.,No.
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?,I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
Queen of diamonds.,Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?,I knew where I was all the time.

I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.,Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.,They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.,It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.,Easy enough.
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.,Not to me.
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.,We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...,Just not to me.
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.,No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
It's temporary.,It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
What happens next?,I live or I die.
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.,A lot smaller.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.,This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?,Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.,I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
Machines do not EAT message.,Look, I...
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.,Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
So why did y...,I did it for her.
However many.  It's not enough.,I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
What about obsessively picking her split ends?,Anxiety.
I don't know wh...,I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
Look, you've never liked me...,Don't flatter yourself.
Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...,We can't live like that.
You bet you are.,How the hell would you know?
Small world.,Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
She's devastated.,Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...,Thanks, but it's under control.
Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...,It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
It's the same choice you made.,Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...,Is that what he told you?
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...,Give 'em my number.
You put filth in my child's mouth.,Aw.
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.,And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.,<u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
Thanks for coming out.,Neutral ground.  What's up?
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...,Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.,What do I have that you don't?

Where you goin'?,I'm gonna get me a drink.
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.,Does Jackie know this?
There's something I need to talk about with you.,What?
There are some rumors...,Like what?
Marty, ignore him.,He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?,I'll be your guest!
Welcome to the show, Scooby.,Thank you.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?,Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Must've been hard being poor.,I'm still poor.
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?,No, Mikey.
Why was he on Death Row?,For rape and murder.
The camerawork's nice.,Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
We're not ready!,Well, I need to see this with an audience!
Mom?,Yes, Mikey?
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.,Got a lot of homework?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.,Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
The same. Same as what?,Just the same.
Maybe he's that one in a million!,Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.,Thanks.
You're welcome.  Dad?Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?,Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?,OK!
Hello, Vi.,What are you doing here?
You're not.,Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
It's over there.,Thanks.
No, not really.,Any books you like to read for fun?
OK.,'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.,Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?,Oh, fine. How are you?
I believe it.,Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Anything I might know about?,Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.,Oh, I don't remember that...
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.,Hunh.
How'd you get it?,It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
Is it loaded?,No, I don't think so...
Scooby, don't! Be careful!,I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.,You should be.
You want some?,No, thanks.
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?,Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
What for?,Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
So like, yeahI caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviewsY'know, I figure I can always drop out.,So where'd you get in?
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?,Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
I'll lead.,Why? Are we going dancing?
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?,Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:
What are we going to do!,Who's got matches?
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.,Used to Filmore, used to.
Go fuck yourself...,Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
Well?,We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
What about Cooper--where is he?,He's in there...
Who's Ryan Cooper?,I'll let the senator tell you.
So, what are we looking at White?,What do you mean?
How goes the roll call?,We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.,Excellent...excellent!
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!,All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
Possibly some coffee?,Moffo!
Where are you trying to reach him?,At his office in the Capitol.
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?,Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.,Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. ,See!  See, I told you.
Now, snap out of it, fella!,Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.,Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... ,Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
So what?,Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.
Yes!,General Schmuck?
I didn't say anything.  What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?,General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.,I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???,To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
You aren't sure!,Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?,Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.,But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
Why do you think I ask?,I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
Good.  Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?,Yes, sir.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.,Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
Are you trying to be insubordinate?,No, sir.
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.,General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.,Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
That is correct, Major.,And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
That about right?,Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast.
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?,I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.,Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
I see.,When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
I'm trying to, sir.,You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.,Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
I guess so.,I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
Right.,Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?,Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.,But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.,Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.,Why can't you cancel it?
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. ,That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
We don't operate like you KGB boys.,Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?,Naturally I am, sir.
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?,Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.,Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.,The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
Between Mach 3 and 4.,Call them every five miles.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.,Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Roger.,Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.,Yeah?
Okay.  Check these points.  Complete radio silence.  To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.  The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?,Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.,Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.,Very interesting.
What's your point, Lothar?,Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Primary circuit is live.,Primary trigger switch.
Yes, Major.,Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
He's dead, all right.,Listen, give me a shot quick!
No, look!  It's "OPE - Recall Mistake.",Recall what mistake?
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.,Why should they call us back?
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.,But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???,Take it easy, Major Kong.
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?,You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
Maybe the warning system's out.,But I get a red light.
We're on course, Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.,What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
Forget it.,I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.,But who would be chosen?
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.,Yeah.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?,Sure, all the time, in Group.
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.,Yeah, I guess.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.,Mm-hm.
Responsibility, progress.,Yes.
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?,Yeah, when's he coming?
Any gunshot victims?,Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Sounds like a bummer.,Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?,Right now?
Do you wanna go to the van?,Now?
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.,Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?,He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
No, no.,Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.,Sorry.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?,Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
A long, long, long, long, while.,Okay, okay.
Good.,Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.,No, no.
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.,Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...,Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
Oh, and guess who showed up.,No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.,No.
Ah, you know people there?,I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.,Jeff! Let's go!
Great.,Really?
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.,Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.,Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Oh, you were in the band?,Yeah.
Score! Yeah!,Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Hey, we're just having a conversation.,This is private property, my friend.
It's safe, come on.,That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.,Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!,Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
It's okay.,Glad it's okay.
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.,No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?,No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
A Porsche.,Mm.
I'd like to.,Oh, yeah?
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?,What was your name again?
Erica.,Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
Oh, wow.,I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.,We were?
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.,Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
Um, mother-daughter.,Pony and I are friends.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.,Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.,I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?,Yeah, fuck 'em.
They let you out?,Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
Yes.,Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?,Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
This is my home.,Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.,They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.,Will you just put the gun down?
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.,Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.,Okay. Nazeer, okay?
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.,Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.,Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?,I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
Of course I do!,Name one.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.,One!
It was a racial incident.,It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
How?,I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
What?,Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Of course.,And?
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.,Mm.
Wait, away?,Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?,Oh, no, no, no.
You really suck, you know that?,Just go.
Yeah, they could be songs.,Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Now?,Yeah.
Great.,Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...,Well, not exactly.
So who are you?,What do you mean?
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.,You know what I'm saying?
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.,Burnfield. No place like it.
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.,Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.,Camel jockey.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.,Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.,Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
I hope you're happy!,This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.,Hey.
Yeah?,Yeah.
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.,Yeah.
I'm moving.,If...
No, I'm going.,Mm-hm.
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?,I think I gotta go.
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.,Where do you get your ideas?
"See what's around you listen to their lies",So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Yeah?,... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.,Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.,Oh that's nice for you.
What?!,You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.,You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!,Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Holy shit.,You just became a statistic!
I'm in, too.,Cleo!
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --,Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Di, we're sorry.  We...,It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?,Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.,Bye.
Positive.,"Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm...
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.,And they get caught!
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.,Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?",She thinks you went to the police.
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?,I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.,Yeah.
Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...,Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!,That was gas, Sweetie.
I'm sorry.,What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Let me explain something...,No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
Shut up.,Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!,Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
Yeah?,Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.,Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Ammo?,Bullets.
And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises.,Or, I could get my own horse...
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.,Thanks!  That'd be great.
Really...,Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
...so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes...,Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
I'm only allowed "G" movies.,Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.,Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.,Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.,Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!,Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?,In a deep freeze.
Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?,Where's the bar?
Good party.,The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.,What's wrong with it?
I didn't.,Thank you.
I had a teacher like that once.,Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.,O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.,You did?
He thinks it could be made into something.,Into what? A lampshade?
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.,Sorry if I crossed you up.
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.,This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...,I'll make it short.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.,I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.,Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
Good.,What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...,Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?,Twenty-two.
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.,I don't want it now.
What happened?,You did.
Hers.,Whose?
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.,That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?,No.
Hello, young fellow.,Hello, Mr. deMille.
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.,I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.,But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...,That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?,Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
Who else ?,Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.,They'll love it in Pomona.
I wrote that with my heart.,Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.,It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
I will not have it butchered.,Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
I want you to do this work.,Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.,There's something wrong with your car, you said.
You'll like it here.,Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
What's that?,Just a scene I cut out.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?,I've lost my car.
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.,What's wrong with It?
Shouldn't we wait for the others?,Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!,Just follow me.
What's the matter with you?,What right do you have to take me for granted?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?,Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --,Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.,I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?,Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
Don't you want to come along, darling?,I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.,You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
That's between you and yourself, Norma.,You think I made that up about the gun...
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!,You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
I made your bed this afternoon.,Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.,I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.,Naturally.  I brought them myself.
That's what I told them.,Good.
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.,There are no locks anywhere in this house.
You send them.  Is that it, Max?,I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
Mr. Gillis, if you please.,Right with you.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?,I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?,She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
You made her a star?,I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
We've come for the car.,What car?
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.,Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.,No?
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.,Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.,Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.,Thank you, Max.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.,All right.  Camera!  Action!
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.,How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.,It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
It must be the girls. One of the girls.,But which one?
A Storm Dragon?,No, a super girl.
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.,Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
I don't feel like it right now.,She didn't take it from you, did she?
Let me out. I have to talk to you.,Later.
Like it?,Yes. It reminds me of home.
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.,What do you feel about me?
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.,Well...I guess one is all right.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.,You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
I'm not mad at you.,It seemed that way to me.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.,Miss what?
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?,Are you asking me for a "date"?
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.,Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
Before you go...,What?
And you can see how you feel about me, right?,Yes.
She's right. They'll string her up.,Do you want to come to Argo City?
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.,I did.
They think I have a concussion.,And you think you're in love.
Why should I believe you?,It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?,But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.,I don't want your help.
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.,Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?,He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
Someone's chasing him.,Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.,Did anybody notice you?
Superman will return it.,Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
You see, a tree is a living thing.,Can you create life?
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.,But what for?
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?,I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?,I'd love to.
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.,What? Me?
Where is inner space?,It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
I was on Earth...,Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Shouldnt've done that.,...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
It's lovely. . .,No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
Zaltar, please help me.,Of course, my dear. What can I do?
But it's impossible.,Why?
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.,Then come with me.
What are you talkin' about?,Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Tuesday.,TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?,Brad.
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --,Brad Wilson.
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.,But Lana, you could --
You...um...you never got married?,Oh...I came close once.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.,I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
Well, aren't you excited?,Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
Well...  Not quite like this.,Mom and I do this all the time.
Do you really know Superman?,We get together sometimes.
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?,Say!
A television set?,Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!,Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!,That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.,Who gets it, the company?
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...,Or socks.
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.,'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!,Decaffeinated too?
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?,Which country?
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?,A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...,Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.,Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.,Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!,I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
Is this whitemail?,Fair's fair.
A computer.,We've already got some.
Anything.,Tell me more...
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.,Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
How you doing down there?,Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.,What about me?
Ricky?  Where...what...,I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.,Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.,You just did, with that great dinner.
The picture looks blurry.,The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
What terrific story?,Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!,Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:,In other words, push this red button.
Oh, Superman!,Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
By hand. Like the pioneers did.,Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
85,000 dollars.,Missing????
That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????,Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
I don't kiss.,Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...,A normal person.
Come on, let's give it a dry run.,Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Are you okay?,She'll be fine.
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.,Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Lois, what are you doing?,When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Actually, yes.,Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?,Really?
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.,Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
A "complimentary corsage.",Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.,Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.,Lois, you're amazing.
It's true. It's true.,Lois, I . . .
Let's go to my place.,Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .,Let's get you inside . . . .
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?,I'm sorry.
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .,Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?,What else is ballast for?
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.,There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris,He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?,Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.,Now This I want to hear.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.,I asked the right question.
Where?,North.
Shhhhhhh!,That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
He has powers as we do . . .,Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
Superman! The --,Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
You must be freezing.,I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .,Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.,Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?,In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?,Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Yes, but will you honor it?,We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
General --- ?,We must combine our strength.
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.,What about here?
That sounds kind of pessimistic.,No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.,I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
Impossible? Why?,Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .,Go on . . .
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.,Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!,Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
I think he's kind of cute.,Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
But he's never there.,Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
What's that?,Our other dinner guest.
Where's Clark?,He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?,Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?,Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.,There!
What was that about?,Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.,What?
What I need this for?,For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...,You are . . .
Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.,First, I have fun.
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?,What do you fear?
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.,No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
But . . . how could you beat him?,High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!,We're running out of smoke.
Don't worry, Mom. I know.,Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
I'll bet you have some good ideas.,Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
Are there any more at home like you?,Not really, no.
Know what?,You described the exact contents of my purse.
Can I take you to the airport?,Not unless you can fly.
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...,Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
What are you doing here?,Screaming
What can I tell you? He's my leader.,Okay.  Take me to your leader.
Shut up.,I didn't say a word.
Mr. Romance...,Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?,I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?,You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
You're not going to hit me?,Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.,I know...
She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.,A night on the town instead of under it?
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?,Lex is going bye-bye.
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!,You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?,Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.,Folks'll ask question.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.,A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
No! You couldn't imagine -,How good it felt!
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.,It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?,Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.,I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
Do you like pink?,Very much.
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?,I guess I...uh...regressed.
Is that real enough for you?,It is for me.
But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!,You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.,Oh, Mr. Luthor...
It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --,Of time, Luthor.
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.,Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.,Maybe I should get help.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.,I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!,We'll see how fast I can fly.
We're...not together.,I'd heard that.  But she's well?
Yes...fine.,And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
But you said...,That's where I'm going.  To see her.
Say hi to Zoe.,I will.
I hope she gets better.,I'll tell her that.
My name is...,Mister, I don't want to know your name.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.,Why are you telling me this?
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.,Why are you telling me this?
They just finished supper.,Was it good?
It just seems...kind of weird.,Why?
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?,I'm not sure.
Have you been waiting long?,A while.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...,Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
Because I have to.,Well I don't.
Why did you do that, Billy?,You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
What do you mean?,You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.,What's that, Dolores?
Because I'd be to blame, right?,Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
Excuse me?,Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
Away from your crazy Mom.,The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
We've only got honey.,I'll...take it straight.
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.,Isn't it a lovely day?
What happened to summer?,Summer's over.  It's fall.
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.,I feel like a princess.
From you?,No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
Nicole!,It's the truth.
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.,Did he say what about?
Is he coming over now?  Right away?,That's what he said.
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...,You hate that.
Dolores.,Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
What about Doreen?,She...she was a friend of mine.
Yes.,That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
I'm in a car wash.,A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?,Why are you calling me, Zoe?
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.,So what's the problem?
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.,'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
Why can't you talk to me?,I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
Oh God, I'm scared.,I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.,You've been retained?
Dolores?,It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?,Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.,Do you have this agreement with you?
You could see the speedometer?,Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?,No.
That was great.,Really?
You're going to blow everyone away.,You mean it?
Of course.,You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
What took so long?,Nothing.
What's that?,Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
The door needs a lock.,Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.,Oh.  I better get some spackle.
What are you up to, Nicole?,Nothing.
Are you sleeping?,No.
What do you mean?,I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
She'll move away.,There's talk of that.
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.,But Charlene...
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.,Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
You told him that?,Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!,I'm late for a date with a dame.
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...,Give me a chance --
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...,I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --,Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?,Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
If looks could kill, I'm dead...,No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...,Did Sidney tell you about it?
Why are you trembling, dear...?,History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...,I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!,I'm taking up the situation with you now...
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...,A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.  Let me have Billy Van Cleve...  Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings...  Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...  No, don't explain your point of view, but...
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?,J.J., Steve isn't...
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!,Susan!...
I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight.,Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!,Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.,Can I come in for a minute?
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...,I have a message from your sister.
Spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too.,I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...,I'll listen one more minute.
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...,Are you finished?
Uh huh.,When?
J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.,You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
He means that much to you...?,Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.,Can't hurt...
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -,Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
I thought he would.,Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
And where was his wife?,I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
Yeah!,And he's a perfect stranger to me.
A girl needs a little romancing before she -,Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
What would you think of me if -,Nothing I didn't think of you before.
But...,But what?
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???,Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...,That's no way to talk...
Or what you see in me, for that matter...,Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?,Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -,Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -,But he isn't going to like this, Susie.  And he makes you nervous, not me.  No, I take that back - he makes me nervous, too.  But I wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.,Why did you call me?
Steve, I...,But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie...
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?,Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
You going to work all day?,I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
Please... let... the kids... go...,Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
Do you know about the chip?,What chip?
They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.,Those lying motherfuckers!
Do you have bandages?,In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
No good.,Let me try mine.
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?,My mission is to protect you.
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?,Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
Where we going?,We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
Can I stop by my house?,Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!,Of course.  I'm a terminator.
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!,Why?
Swear.,What?
Everything.,Cool.
Does it hurt?,I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
Not even of dying?,No.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?,No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
This is tactically dangerous.,Drive faster.
Is it dead?,Terminated.
No!,I'm sorry, John.
Easy money!,Where'd you learn all this stuff?
Out of the way, John!,No!  Don't kill him!
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.,Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.
Yeah.  Drag, huh?,I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.,Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
John, get out of the way!!,SHOOT!!!!
They took him from me.,It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
I know!,Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
Kyle, don't go!,There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.,And what it that?
You broke my arm!,There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.,And Skynet fights back.
Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.,Why attack Russia?
That's because you had a proper upbringing.,That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?,I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.,Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
I guess so, sir.,You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
Where you from, David?,was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?,Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.,David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.,Colonel. Pleasure.
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.,In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.,There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
Let Furtwngler go. Please.,I have a duty.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.,Then you're going to kill me.
Your mother, too.,Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
Mine's the Eleventh.,But... he only wrote nine, Major.
Major, Major... he's here ...,Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
I can't do this. It's not right.,What's not right?
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.,If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.,I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.,May I ask a question?
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?,Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
Who warned you?,Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
What did Goering say?,He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
What telegram?,'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
Then you are wrong.,Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
have no idea what ordinary people thought.,No!
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.,And what did he say?
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.,Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
How can I know such a thing?,I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwngler today?,I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
It's Dr. Furtwngler's baton, which I stole.,The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Show me.,Show you?
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.,Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.,Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
And ask him about his private life.,His private life?
Was looking at Furtwngler like that?,I don't know what you mean, Major.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?,Sure.
Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?,First oboe.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.,Absolutely not.
Yes, Chuck?,Come to the office, please.
The Uzi 9 millimeter.,You know your weapons, buddy.
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.,
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.,We will, kiddo.
Reese...you got a first name?,Kyle.
We gotta get you to a doctor.,It's okay.  Forget it.
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?,I volunteered.
You volunteered?,It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.,Okay.  Talk some more.
Bag some Z's?,Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
That's where we're going.,Why?
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?,What about it?
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.,Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
He'll find us, won't he?,Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
And so you feel nothing.,It's better that way.
Sarah.,We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
And who was the enemy?,SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?,Yes.
Send a unit.,I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--,Shut up.
You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.,Projections were far too optimistic.
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.,The stock will turn.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?,Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.,There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...,Then, you kiss his ass.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...,A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
Alright... okay...,He's turning blue!
This is nuts.,What <u>is</u> your problem?
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.,Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
I'll give you a boost.,You first.
Please...,I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
There's a ladder here.,My hero.  Let's go.
I'll wait.,It's not like anyone could actually open it.
That one did.,... two hundred dollars a toe.
What exactly do you do?,Investment banking.  Moving money from place to place.
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?,Well... the red bra.
Okay.,I thought...
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.,I don't...
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?,Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...,Who the fuck cares?
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.,It might be best if we didn't talk.
Who is it?,What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.,What... what do you mean?
What are you <u>doing</u> here?,I'm back from the dead.
They won't...,They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
Nicholas...,Shut up!
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.,I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Yes.,Boyfriend?
You look good.,So do you.  And to think I was worried...
I redecorated.  What about you?,Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
But, will you?,Are you still on mediction?
What's this all about, Connie?,Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
Who?,C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
What have they been doing to you?,Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!,Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?,Stop it!
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...,Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?,Yes.
I need your car, Elizabeth.,What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.,Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...,What is?
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.,What kind of vacation?
May I make two suggestions... ?,Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
You don't need me...,Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
I've been so lonely.,I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.,First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
You did?  How is he?,Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Invitations: the Museum Gala.,No.
Your ex-wife.,I know who she is.  Take a message.
I wasn't expecting you.,Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
Just what I told you.,Nothing else?
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?,You're joking.
He hasn't called back.,What about the house?
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.,You warm my heart.
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.,Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?,It's somebody's idea of a joke.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?,I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
That could have been worse.,Yeah.
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.,Go ahead.
And those are Luke's and mine.,There's a carriage house around back.
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.,And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
You used the wrong test.,Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.,And that will be a good place to end this study.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.,This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.,I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.,Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
Sorry.,For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?,I don't know.
You know what he's really upset about?,What?
What happened?,There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
Have either of you seen David Watts?,No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
What do you want?,Oh!  You scared me.
Why do you need a chain like that?,That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
Yes.,She was unhappy.
It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.,Why would we --
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.,This?  It's from a thrift shop.
No.,A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?,I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
How could he have left without his keys?,Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
Theo... Did you?,Maybe you did it yourself.
Why?,I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
What'd you come back for, babe?,Just had to be sure.
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.,Then let's go get you one.
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?,I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Not for you, clearly.,I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
I'm not.,No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.,For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
What's the matter?,Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
No.,Why not?
How they goin', kid?,Not bad.
When you find the guy, you'll know.,What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
Our black friends?,No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
Oh really?  Where you from?,England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
I can take care of the paperwork.,Yeah?
CQ what?,Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?,Round about, yeah.
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.,No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?,I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.,I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.,Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
You're kiddin' me, right?,What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?,Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.,And that's where you met Jenny.
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.,How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.,Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
Has he?,They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
Steady on.,You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.,What post office?
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.,Really.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?,No, but I know what he means.
Sort a few things out.,Been busy, have you.
What was that, then?,I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
Oh, it just ended, then.,Now who's being sarcastic?
You weren't disappointed in her, then.,In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.,He give me your address.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?,Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
I see.,Based in London, but with international concerns.
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.,Why not.
Are you serious.,Have you ever known me not to be.
Oh, I was gonna say ...,Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.,I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.,He alive to see this?
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.,She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
Where's Big Sur?,Up the coast.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.,What's in Big Sur?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.,How do you know?
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.,Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.,Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.,And that is?
Don't you work with Ian?,Ian?
That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.,Yeah?
Been away a lot.,Where else?
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.,But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.,The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.,Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.,Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
What?,I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
I don't get it.,I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
How'd you get in here.,Walked.
You know her?,Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
Hello there.,What are you doing here?
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.,That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
You must know Ian.,I don't.
She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything.,<u>Why</u> then.  Why did you do it!
...Yes?,At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
Ann--,A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?,Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
Hello, Mr Crane.,Hello, Birdy.
...I guess I've been all wet.,But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
Ah yes, a music lover.,Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.,I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
...she can go up there.,Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.,Huh.
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.,Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave something at the shop?,No. I might be interested in that, uh, business proposition--
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.,And how do we share--
...Was that a pass?,Maybe.
No problem!,Way out of line.
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?,Yeah.
How ya doin', Ed?,OK. Take your coat, Ann?
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?,Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Uh-huh.,Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.,Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
Please, Ed.,But it's...
What kind of man *are* you?,Big Dave--
Rye.,Just coffee.
...What a knucklehead.,Who?
...What's so damn strange about that?,I didn't say a word.
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.,Congratulations, Gina.
Should I... should I tell you why?,You don't have to tell me anything.
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?,...OK.
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.,*I* was with her.
How did you get into the store?,I took Doris's keys.
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?,...I don't think so.
Not guilty, your honor...,I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.,He a good man?
...Probity.,Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.,Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.,Yeah.
That was quite something.,He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
Russians exploded an A-bomb.,Yeah.
Jesus...,Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?,Yeah.
This hair.,Yeah.
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.,Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
...How you today, Ed?,OK.
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!,That's very generous.
...We goin'?,Huh? No.
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?,We're just closing, friend.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?,You'll go to the prison hospital.
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?,No.
Someone broke into this room.,Anything missin'?
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.,Do they have to wear uniforms?
Yes.,I don't want to scare people.
Fifteen... what's next?,Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!,What doors?
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.,Where the hell are you?
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.,I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --,This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.,The sub-basement?
What's that?,All right everybody, hold up!
What's that doing here?,I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?,I'd say we're in its home.
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.,How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.,I'm not giving up.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.,You're right.
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.,We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.,Yes.
I don't want to go this way.,Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
Not that big.,Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
They were yellow!,You're color blind.
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?,He's right.  Follow me.
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.,But at what a price.
That's impossible.,I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
Mbwun.,What's that?
What kind of egg is it?,It's reptilian.
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!,What kind of hormones?
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!,So what?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?,An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?,Maybe not.
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.,You have time to talk?
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.,I don't understand.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.,What happened?
Where would we find it?,I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.,You were behind me?  Running after me?
They're all heavily armed.,All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
What was it?,I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
Genetic damage?,When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
Pendergast?  Are you all right?,No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
You're not.  Where is it?,Gone.
Is there another way around?,No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
We have to try and draw it off!,How?
You smell that?,It's coming.  Run.
We're not going to make the storage room!,Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.,I can't!
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?,Today.
What happened down there?,He was tidying up his garbage.  I was going to call you.  But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep.
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.,All prop cars accounted for?
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.,What have we missed?
We're not watching the sea.,Why would we--
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.,Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.,A window onto the human condition?
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.,But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
Are we talking Emmies?,Certainly a nomination.
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.,No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--,All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
The creator of what?,A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
I have a map.,Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
How can they have a child?,It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--,--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.,I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.,If we don't go now, it won't happen.
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.,Yeah?  Outta what?
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.,So when are you leaving?
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.,Yeah, what happened?
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.,Are you okay?  You look like shit.
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?,I told you I can't.
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>,So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?,Truman, you're gonna be late!
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.,Gee, that's great.
How did it go today?,A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.
Where have you been?,I've been thinking--
It'd be an adventure.,I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
What're you doing down here?,Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?,You blaming me for the traffic?
How's your hip?,Oh, just so.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.,When you get to Fiji?
They're going to stop me talking to you.,There's no one here.
Well, we're FBI agents.,You're not FBI agents.
I need your clothes, Byers.,Me?
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --,Yes. I know.
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --,Nothing completely conclusive --
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --,Working with?
What is it you find incredible?,Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
You've got something to show me.,Yes.
How can this be?,The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
And if it's unsuccessful?,Incinerate it. Like the others.
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.,Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
Yes.,We have a situation. The members are assembling.
Who?,Kurtzweil, we think.
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?,No. Don't bother.
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?,Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.,Show you right on a map.
How's that?,Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
You a reporter?,I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
The Federal Building was too well guarded.,No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?,And one little boy.
I'll know soon enough.,What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
And they tell me I'm paranoid.,Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
How can I reach you?,You can't.
Now what?,It's locked?
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.,Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.,Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
Scully?,Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.,All I told them was the truth.
Mulder -- what are you doing?,Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
You said you weren't coming?,I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
Been where?,Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
This is weird, Mulder.,Very weird.
Where'd they go?,I don't know.
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --,We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.,You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.,I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
I can't go any farther.,Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
Well, call General McAddie.,I don't have his number.
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.,About what?
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --,-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
Mr. Mulder.,What happened to Kurtzweil?
What is it?,A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
Where is he?,Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
Sing a song of sixpence...,A pocketful of rye...
Did we go sailing?,Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.,Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.,Yes mother.
Sing a song of sixpence.,A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Nothing.,Why did we stop?
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?,Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.,I'll be fine.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...,I don't need them anymore...
There's always a chance they'll confess.,Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
What then?,The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.,Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
This is Stargher we're talking about?,Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?,Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
Where the hell are we?,Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
Well look at that.,I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.,It doesn't matter...
Thank you.,No problem.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?,They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
She changed the codes.,What's wrong?
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.,No.
You're looking well.,Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
So?,Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.,It's his dog.
Here he is.,Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.,They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?,I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
Den leuten.,Ja, ja, ja.
You were awfully good.,Do you understand German?
Well, I saw you at the funeral.,I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.,Dr. Winkel told me that.
...at all.,I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
Anything really wrong with your papers?,They're forged.
Can I hear you?,In German?
...to steal my girl.,Where is she?
Oh, that was many years ago.,Tell me more.
...and buried him.,Anna.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?,Yes.
Let's go away.,What's the matter?
Let's not get into any more trouble.,Wait here.
I wish I knew.,Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
I'm going back home.,Why?
Have you seen Calloway?,Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
He liked to laugh.,Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
...and my lover. He was Harry.,Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
...again.,There isn't enough for two laughs.
Are you going, too?,Oh...
How do you know?,I saw him today.
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.,Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
...anyway?,From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?,Two weeks ago.
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.,What did you say? I'm sorry...
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?,No, not yet.
...Austrian Police Headquarters.,Can I have that woman's passport?
Can you tell me whose...,Fellow called Lime.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?,Calloway.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?,A bruised lip.
A parrot bit me.,Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
So would I.,Bring him in.
...in the morning.,Thank you. Excuse me.
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.,How about the doorway?
Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...,Of course.
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?,All right, Calloway. You win.
Wait a minute - let me out.,Well, there's not much time.
Be sensible, Martins.,I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?,Take him to Sacher's.
...his number.,I'll look it up for you.
How long can one stay here on this stage money?,Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.,Who?
Very popular, sir.,Very popular. Are you staying long?
Listen...,Yes.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...,It's good to see you, Holly.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?,I told the police.
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.,You wouldn't do anything.
You told them, didn't you?,Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.,I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?,Coffee.
You really liked it?,At the end of every chapter --
...you know and all that.,But he said he died instantaneously.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?,A Roumanian.
Baron Kurtz.,Must be some mistake.
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?,Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
You gotta tell your story to the police.,Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.,Now, hold on.
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.,Well make it your business.
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?,He didn't want to get involved.
Mr. Martins...,Not when I get interested.
Should I make it all fact?,Why no, Mr. Martins.
...Mr. Martins?,Never.
You. You're the guy that lent me the money.,Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?,Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath.,Nice work.
He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.,That's the wrong one.
I don't know - I'm American.,So?
A shark fin?,I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Big?,Yes.
She is gone!,What happened?
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.,Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.,It's on an island that no one get to.
One kilometer,Two.
Did you sleep well?,Not too bad.
You think?! Based on what?,There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.,The Zionists aren't Nazis.
What do you think you're doing?,Who the fuck are you?
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.,No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
Why no silencer?,You want it to be an event.
Is he a Nazi?,I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.,Yes, I am. Basically I am.
I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one.,You weren't complaining about my play last time.
I'm coming to your room tonight.,No.
Where'd you get this?,I stole it. From a synagogue.
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.,Why not?
It looks a little like a swastika.,It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
The sex is better.,Even though his dick is so big?
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...,V'asitem...
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.,Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
Fuck that.,Don't curse in front of it.
No, I think you shouldn't.,Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?,It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...,Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
You want a punch in the mouth?,Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.,Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
I don't know. I just want to try it.,Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...,You gotta get out of here.
Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.],Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
That's a much easier game.,Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...,Did you see how they reacted to him?
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.,We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?,They're liars and cowards.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?,It's the truth....
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.,I agree.
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?,In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.,German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
And Jewish men like to get it.,Everybody likes to, don't they?
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.,Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?,Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
Who? How would I know him?,He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?,Do you know who you're fucking with here?
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?,No.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.,How did you...?
Which <i>Times</i> guy?,With the shoes... There was more than one?
It was a nine millimeter.,You're lying.
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.,I can't say that.
Don't tell me what I --,...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
Lina Moebius. And you are...?,Daniel Balint.
Balint?,It's German.
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.,Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
Do you feel you're making progress here?,You mean Ilio Manzetti?
How have things been going?,Fine.
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?,Steve...
What are you doing here?,I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.,Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
Tell it to Hitler.,Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?,Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
Isn't it true?,No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
Which was his room?,Number ten.
Open it up.,Here...
That's all we've got left.,It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
It's not going to be fine. It's --,Just do it.
Are you an artist?,No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.,I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
Where do you think you're going?,...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.,And that's when the Mets started to stink.
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.,Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
We tested the new bomb.,What?
Do you think I...,Danny, please, we don't want to know.
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?,Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
Are you going to keep it?,Yes.
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.,Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?,Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.,... So am I.
Good afternoon.,I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
You're right.  You're fired.,Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
I tell you she's mine!,Hello!
This is a great pleasure.,Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.,Congratulations.
And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.,Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
Well, good night, then...,You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Jacques!  Johana!,Enzo!
Because you'd laugh.,I won't, I swear.
The medics are looking all over for you.,I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
Is he here?,He's training.
What's with the voice?,It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
And... does the voice come back?,For others, yes... For you, who knows?
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.,Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
That's good.,How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
No.,Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
No, no!,Not at all!
Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?,Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
You still collect them?,Yes.
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!,Thank you, thank you very much!
That's good.,Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.,You say that because you have the title!
No!  I would never cheat you.,Well that's very nice of you.
Don't you have a heater?,Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
I recognize you.,We saw each other a little while ago.
You look adorable.,Thank you...
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.,Lucky I was there to save you.
I'd better get back now.,You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.,How do you know that?
Jacques, you set a world record.,I did?
Hello?,It's me... Johana.
How are you?,I got fired.
Well, then, talk to me some more.,... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
What's wrong?,It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.,That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
This is the hotel San Domenico?,Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.,Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
Uncle Louis!,No, no.  It's true.  When I was in New York, oh boy!  Before my accident, you understand? 
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?,Well... here.
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.,Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
It's his heartbeat.,Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.,Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
What is it honey... the frenchy?,Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
What are they for?,They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.,I'll have to talk to the driver.
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.,Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.,What's up?
So why the long face?,It's Esther. Santa's got her.
Client notes. Sorry.  What can I do for you?,My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
Any sign of Santa?,He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
So, now what?,Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
Want to get a drink?,Sure. Why not.
What was that!?,I said, do you come here often!?
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.,Kiss me you Semitic stud!
When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?,Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so...
We do!,I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
What are you doing here?,Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
So don't show a picture.,You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.,Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?,Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
What's wrong with him?,He's still working out some identity issues.
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.,I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!,But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.,If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
Where's my girlfriend Santa?,I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
What's going on? Why'd he stop?,Maybe he ran out of ammo.
My soninlaw. What do you think of him?,That depends. How much money has he?
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and -,Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?,I don't know.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.,You really think so, Charlie?
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.,They all say the cat killed this second girl.
Sure, I like my leopards,But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
What's left of him.,Where? Where did you find it?
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.,Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
What, senorita?,When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
Love is different for different people.,I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too  when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.  But these last weeks will always be our secret  a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click  click  click.,She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ,You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
Doc -- something you said the other day --,Yes?
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.,Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
That was unfortunate.,That was a calamity!
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.,I thought they came right past here 
Chief, don't you understand what this means?,You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
Get it out of here!,Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Makes no difference. Get him out!,Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
That's easy. Me.,I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
Get it out of here!,Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
That's easy. Me.,I thought - is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
No  not yet.,And I never will -- you know what's between us - we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
Suppose I slip them a few bucks  for the funeral expenses.,Don't be soft.
Who was the other man?,I don't know  a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
I can use them.,Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.,He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.,I know. Funerals.
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --,Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.,You're positive of that, aren't you?
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --,Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.,We will 
Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.,Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You dont mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is hes either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But Ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why Im here at such a late hour. I need 20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.,Excuse me?
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.,Perhaps I should come back when youre...
Laurence!,I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
I still dont buy your story but I figured it cant do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.,You drive a hard bargain.
Im impressed. That information could have cost me 20,000.,Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight Im convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
Mr Lombard...,How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
I... Well, were burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but its late and with the funeral...,Arent you curious to know about Friedman?
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish youd use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what youre owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?,I guess the news youd sent me after Friedman didnt go down too well, eh?
What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?,My brother hung himself.
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.,Leon hung himself.
Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...,Leon hung himself...
Youre wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought hed wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I dont know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didnt know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.,You dont say.
One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?,Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.
Five years of it. Surely, youd have divorced him if he disgusted you?,You splendid bastard...
And you still havent told me why you sent me after Friedman.,Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?,I didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Dont you believe in simplicity?,Should I?
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But its never that complicated really.,You seem to know what youre talking about.
What do you suggest?,I dont know. Everyones dead...
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?,Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
Crow what?,Croissants.
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?,Im fine standing, thank you.
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there?,The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?,I thought youd never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... Theres a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassys out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?,Im sure Ill find a way.
A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my sons. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... Theres some cold chicken salad in the fridge if youre hungry.,Thank you. But I think Ill go to bed. Its been a long day.
Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.,Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Look, you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?,Whos the guy? Whos the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate Id have had to kill him.
Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.,Italian? The Mafia...?
Im finished here and Im tired, Emily. You shouldnt be here. Now dont make it worse.,A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think Ill get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, itll be too late.
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitneys trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...,And losing you, wed lose him. And that would be a shame, dont you agree?
Weve still got the Italian...,Thats right. Wheres the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?,Yes... Good, good...
I dont know. Hes gone!  Hes gone. I dont fucking know where, I swear... Hes gone. On holiday...,...On holiday?
Ever seen him before?,No... No...  I swear...
Where?,What?
Whats the Ambassador?,Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. Hes got a safe...  I need a doctor...
What about the staff?  Theyre in on whats going on, arent they?  How many of them?,F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, Ive got to get to...
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?,B-Black...
Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year.,Good.
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?,La what?
I came to feed your fish. I didnt know...,Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, trs bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandmes services quelquun rcemment... Vous tes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe its there with...,Its not.
Piss off!,Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. Its important.
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?,I hope its not too significant.
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?,You wouldnt be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?,Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.,Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?
Problems?,Is my money in there?
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?,No. In Hampstead... Why?
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?,Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Maybe I dont.,Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.,Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where theyre not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
Its about the puppy. You got the money?,Yeah.
I gather weve done business with a friend of yours?,Have you?
Evening. Table for one?,No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
We didnt quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...,Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?
Theyre German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. Its not guilt, more of a curse...  And then theres something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think thats just one of Leons dark delusions...,Do you know Leons parents names?
Fine...,Good. You neednt worry about the Austrian anymore. Hes dead. Ill be in touch.
And you aint neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?,No...
Barstows 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever youre heading, I reckon somebodyll pick you up.,Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you...
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You dont know Leon, do you?,I know his work better than I know him.
What about which girlfriend?,Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Yeah. Why? Youre going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?,Fucked-up fucking weird.
Quest-ce que tu veux?,Un Autrichien. Negociant en pr- pubescents.
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matine.,Tu sais o me trouver.
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...,O est pass ton salon?
Five seconds. Then you die.,Fuck...
Why did you kill Friedman?,Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. Its wrong. Fucking wrong.
Why did you kill him?,Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?
Are you telling me Friedman didnt tell you I was here looking for him?,If he had, youd be dead.
Mossad?,Its a good guess...
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become have-it- where-its-at... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...,Cost what?
Very funny. Can I go on now?,Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...,Very generous of you all.  How much?
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!,How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
What did they say?,Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...,Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?,Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.,But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.,But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
I don't know it.  I feel it.,You make it sound so simple...
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.,Tell me...
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?,You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!,Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
We must sound the retreat!,Not yet!
I am ready now...,Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.,I -- I don't understand...
One day you will.,You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!,I'm staying, Jean.
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!,I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?,No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
I can't read.,Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
Didn't you also carry a banner?,Yes...
Why?,To avoid killing anyone.
No, I... I held it up to...,You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?,Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
W-w-what are you doing?!,Performing a miracle.
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.,... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
My king will pay any ransom you ask.,Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
God defeated the English, not me.,And God who allowed you to be caught?
Quick -- hide in here...,What about you?
Who are you?,Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
You must take the oath!  Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.,I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?,Not long ago...
The voice was in your cell?,Yes.
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.,And may I go to Mass?
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!,It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
You will??,For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.,But... her army's so small now...
She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!,She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.,I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
Supposing she's an assassin?,Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?,Noooo!
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?,Go and ask him yourself.
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.,You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...,The wind will be against us...
What's going on?,We're taking back the Tourelles!
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?,Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?,I... submit to Our Lord.
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?,It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?,No...!
And you didn't jump of your free will?,No!
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?,God knows, but it was a bad idea!
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...,... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...,I said, kneel!
You don't believe me anymore?,We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
What have you done to me?,I -- I -- I...
Who... who are you...?,I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
I don't know... I thought...,YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I... don't know... what do you want from me?,Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...
What are you doing out here?,I might ask you the same question.
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...,And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
God asked you to do something?,Yes... lots of things!
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...,So your memory's coming back?
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?,Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...,What are you doing on the wall?
You think you are ready now?,Yes, my lord.
You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...,I need to confess.
My father's.,I'm sure he'll forgive you.
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.,Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
So... everything sounds... wonderful?,Yes, it is.
Then... why are you here so often?,I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
Who is this "he"?,He never says his name.
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?,It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Someone you know?,Yes.
A beauty. Who is she?,A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
Dorota!,I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.,Dorota.
What did I tell you?,What are you doing?
Must feel better this side of the wall.,Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
I'm on the run!,What's happened?
Calm down, what, what is it?,They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
Halina?,What?
Believe me, they've picked him up.,Tough luck.
Can you help us?,It costs.
I've no money.,Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.,Who told you?
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...,Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Boys, boys...,Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
Mama, that was a great dinner.,It certainly was.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --,That makes a change.
You know what we do? We use psychology.,We use what?
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.,Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
A good place for what?  He's insane!,Just shut up.
I know.,You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?,I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
What's that mean, no employment certificate?,You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.,You're amazing, Jehuda.
Jehuda, give me something to do.,You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.,There are always notices going up.
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?,You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.,Wladek! How are you?
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?,What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
How long have you been here?,Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.,If you need help...
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.,You made contact?
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.,God forbid!
Where are you hiding?,In the attic.
What's happening?,We're getting out.
Are the Russians here?,Not yet.
I don't know how to thank you.,Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
What about you?,I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
Watch your feet!,Watch your feet!
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.,Baines is packing up?
My REAL father was a famous German composer,Ohh the tag is broken.
Ohhh I've never been there. ,Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.,No, no bible readers.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.,I'll be back.
She looks tired.,She's stunted, that's one thing.
What's he say?,Someone died here. It's tapu.
You'd have to organise it up here.,Yes, I thought that.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.,No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.,What are they?
You have to wash them.,They are washed.
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.,You've missed this bit.
Which way are the rooms?,Who told ya this guy was in here?
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?,Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.,I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
Jesus, what a bundle.  Did you know he was that loaded?,Hell no, I just cut into him.  I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes.
Twist!  When did you get back in town?,Coupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.,Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.,I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.,You think my play is bad?
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.,What?
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.,Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.,He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.,We'll be waitin'.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?,I'm busy, Floyd.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.,Which one?
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.,Hackers.
Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy we called him.  Runs a few protection rackets for Carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along.  Me and Danny been friends since we were six. Take a good look at that face, Floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in Chicago who'd like to do the same thing.  You understand what I'm sayin'?,Yes sir.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.,I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.,Neither are we.
You just worry about your end, kid.,If we ever get to it.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?,It was too noisy.
Henry.,Yeh.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.,Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
You in?,Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
How ya doin'?,Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.,You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.,What for?  I haven't done anything.
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?,But I got a train to make.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.,But what about all these other people?
I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.,All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
Looks like he missed ya.,Yeh, this time anyway.
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.,You move right along, don't ya.
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.,Okay, Tootsie.
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.,All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information.
You stayin' in or not?,I'm in.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.,What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.,He's right, Les.
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.,How am I gonna do that?
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.,Don't think I know him.
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?,I'll make parole.
What is this?  I got work to do.,Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.,Come on, gimme a break.
Why not?,You know how they are... sex...
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.,Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
Cheer up, darling.,I'm sorry.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?,It's all right.
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?,Just a minute...
Oh, Andy.,Don't cry.
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!,Dorothy!
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.,You're talking like a crazy person,
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.,Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?,You're high enough.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?,I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?,Shush!
All right, then.  I'll tell them.,I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
I don't believe it! You're lying!,There!
Another Martini --,Hello, there!
You know, we know each other.,Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.,tried him once -
You heard about Julia Wolf?,Yes.
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.,Where did you hit her?
Dead?,He's been dead for three months.
It's been the same one for three months.,Forgive me.  How are you?
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.,Yes, she would.
How's your brother?,He's all right.
You can take that out to the car.,Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?,He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Nothing.,What'd he think it was to you?
Have you got a pistol permit?,No.
So would I.,It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?,They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
He's holding out on you.,Let's go and see.  Taxi!
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.,Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.,Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
What're you doing here?,I'll take care of him.
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?,Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
There are a few things we want to check up on.,I see.
Good morning --,Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.,Want to take a poke at him?
Don't mind what she says, Chris.,How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
I'll get some.,You've said that for weeks.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.,This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.,Don't you remember....
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...,You're going to return every cent of it!
I can't! I haven't got it!,What did you do with the rest?
I never had it.,Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
Oh, hello.  Come on in.,Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.,I trust you.
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.,I haven't been a detective for four years.
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.,No word at all?
It might.,He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.,Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.,Well, don't you?
But he has nothing to do with it!,That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
This is all very pleasant but why are here?,I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.,Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.,He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
What's that?,This is your party.
Why do you say that?,Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --,Oh, this is Andy --
How many drinks have you had?,Six Martinis.
What hit me?,That last Martini.
Who's that?,Santa Claus.
Where did you get that?,She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
No.,Maybe a drink would help you.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.,There's nothing I can do to help her.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?,Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
You're a fine watch dog.,He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.,That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids.  That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
Aren't you hot in that?,I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.,Your guess is as good as mine.
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.,Catch me letting you go alone!
He's just been for a walk.,We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
You mean, he might be hiding there?,I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.,I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
You bet I wouldn't.,Not with all your money!
You dog!,Goodbye, darling.
Back to California,My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.,I did find him!
Wynant's body?,Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.,That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?,Huh?
What things made you so sure?,Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
I'm going to tell her.,Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
What are you going to do?,I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
Mimi!,Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner..... 
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?,Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
Trying to put it off on her?,Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
Nick Charles here?,Yes.  Nick!
Bonds, sir?,I know I left them there.
Home?,I'm fired.
Turn the car around.,Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.,You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.
What's it say?,Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
It's a map, I think that's what it is.,There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?,I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.,Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.,Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.,You just go when I say go.
The US Army:  Always an adventure.,Let me see the map.
Missile!,Move!
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.,Ready when you are.
You ready?,All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.,What about the gold?
What happened?,I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...,You said he was a deserter.
Wes--,Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
Thanks for taking care of this for me.,Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
Just keep quiet.,I have to answer him.
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.,It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.,There might be.
This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?,Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.,OH MY GOD!
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--,We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
Third.  What you're going to do with your third.,Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
Take the binoculars.,Wh-what do you think--
They're not going to--,It's the only way.  We drive!
SAY IT!,I got that...sir.
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.,Faster we get there, faster we get back.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.,Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?,We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.
Why you got to move away to talk!?,We're going to be right over here.
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.,Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
You're not losing trust, are you?,Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
X marks the spot.,Something like that.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.,I hope it means something, otherwise...
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?,We're not going to do anything.
If they land--,If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
Think there might be more Iraqis?,Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
A whole lot of nothing.,So where do we start?
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.,It's giving.
It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.,I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
What?,We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
I don't see how that plan's any better.,Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.,Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
What the hell took so long.,Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.,It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?,We'll find our way.
First Wes, now you?,I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
Getting cold.,It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.,No!
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?,Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on.
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.,Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.,Probably.
Oh, God...,They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
Slip out your M-16.,And then what?
Can't you--,I don't have a weapon.
What do we do?,We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
What do we do?,We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
Why haven't they killed us!?,I don't know!
...Wes...?,You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
I didn't say that.  I never said--,Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
Epps?,What?
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.,Really?
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.,He'll slow down.
Some good ones.,They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.,I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?,I'm saying don't do it accidently.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?,I thought it would be good to know.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.,For real?  A treasure?
Jaeger?,What?
Jaeger?,What!?
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--,It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.,Oh, Jesus!
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?,...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
How long we going to keep this up.,Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.,I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
Think we can make it?,We make it, or we go back empty handed.
I think he wants something to drink.,I'm not wasting my water on him.
HUMMMM.....,What happened?
I'm not hungry.,Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
I haven't done anything.,Don't be so sure.
I've never been under the table before.,Look,dirt!
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.,What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
I'll try.,Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
What are you doing?,I don't know.
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.,Don't let them separate us.
It's the end.,I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.,What?
I thought you were through with it!,We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
What?,We're leaving.
I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.,Impossible!
Not very encouraging.,On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
I've got it!  Astounding!,What?
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..,We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
Right now.,But you can't...you.
What?,Look!
What are you doing here?,I was lost.
How do you know?,Look more closely.
That's not it.,No?
She's not there,No......  She's dead THX........
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....,You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...,Yes...
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-,-Where?
Dispatch, this is Reilly.,Go ahead.
Who the heck're you?,You the Bomb Squad?
What was-? Why...?,That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.,So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Treat. We treat devices.,Anything else I should know?
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?,She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Only once, at Redstone.,Where...?
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.,Oh yeah? Prove it.
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.,Then let's go see what they missed.
This is where the van was parked.,Yep.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...,Look, it's a longshot...
Right.,Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
Why do you do it?,I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 
So cut both.,One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.,Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Ex-girlfriend?,Be right back.
What's up?,Where you guys at?
Fuck factor?,Off the scale.
Talk to me. Let's assess.,Right.
What... ?,When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
Alright!,We've created a monster.
Cover.  It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.,Who is he?
What is that?,Security.
Alex, please.,Stay in the truck.
Drop it.,Take him!
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.,I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
What about the ballistics report?,Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.,We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.,Look who's talking, old man.
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.,Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?,What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
Reilly, Vice. I-,Quiet!
Vice cop on a homicide?,Captain assigned me to assist you.
Nice to be here.,That feeling won't last long.
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-,I'll do it.
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.,I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
Sir...,I thought I told you--
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.,I promised her she'd be safe.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-,I know.
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-,We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.,In a moment.
still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.,Where did you find it?
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?,You see--  No, no! And <u>yet</u>--  <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--
But--,I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.,The type they marry.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.,Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
I would start with cocktails.,Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
And as for you, waiter--,Yes, Baron?
I don't want to see you at all!,No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
You can trust me.,Yes, Baron. Thank you. 
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--,For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
But not now.,Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--,No, to you--M'sieu <u>Monescu</u>.
Very well, m'sieu.,Otherwise I'll call the police
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.,Now just a minute, Major--
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?,No--no.
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?,I would like to.
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.,You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
Thank you!,Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
The pepper, too?,No, thank you.
I like you, Baron.,I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
Monescu!,Gaston Monescu.
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.,And take the twenty thousand francs ...
Right.,Sweetheart, what day is today?
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!,What?
By the way, how is your German?,<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.,<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.,What time is your rendezvous?
Don't you <u>realize</u>--,Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Lily, you must listen to me.,Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Then you go into the foyer.,Yes.
Naturally I did.,Oh!
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.,M'sieu Laval!
Yes.,Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?,What?
Eighteenth century.,Yes!
Beautiful specimen.,It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
I see.  She must have been very happy here.,Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--,Then I mislay my checkbook--
I'll be delighted.,And so will M'sieu Giron.
No--yours, madame.,M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! ,You would?
And you're going to fall for them.,So you think you can get me?
Any minute I want!,You're conceited--
But attractive--,<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
Adolph J. Giron.,And you expect me to believe that?
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?,Giron...!
Goodbye...,Goodbye.
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.,But it could have been glorious.
No, m'sieu!,Yes, madame!
But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?,I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 
Your bag?,Yes, my bag!
No--I'm sorry.,But you saw it here.
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.,That's right.
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.,The pumps --
I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.,The ship will sink.
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?,Yes, I understand. Thank you.
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.,Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.,I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
I told you you wanted to take this call.,Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.,Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.,You wanted to see the propellers?
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.,Not the better half.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?,I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
Is this in any way unclear?,What do I tell your mother?
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.,No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.,We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.,If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?,No, but we're making excellent time.
Why have we stopped?,We've struck ice.
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --,I know what ice fishing is!
I'm Jack Dawson.,Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
So, you got a name by the way?,Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.,You're welcome. Rose.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?,That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
It is that simple.,Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...,No, no! Just with her hands.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.,I see you.
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?,Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.,Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.,They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.,You're right. Only you can do that.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?,Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
What is it? A sapphire?,A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.,He does landscapes.
You're trembling.,It's okay. I'm alright.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.,I know, I know.
It's getting quiet.,Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
Yes sir.,And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.,Would you like anything?
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.,It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once.
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?,Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
Don't come any closer.,You had it the entire time?!
Anya, I think you're crazy.,Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--,How'd you ever get away with it?
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?,Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.,I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?,Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
Feeling a little better, I see.,Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
Isn't she lovely?,Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 
Did you find it?,No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
Where'd you get it?,Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?,Not at all.
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. ,I'll bet a couple of hundred.
Could I see you a minute?,Sure!  Excuse me.
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.,I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. ,I'll say she is!
You've got lipstick all over you.,I could stand some more--
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?,So you washed it off!
There's soft music--,--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.,What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
Tell me.,A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.,For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.,You mean that?
What?--,I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?,Lose?--I won a little--
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.,Jimmy!
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!,No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Not a chance.,Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?,No, sir?
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.,You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
They won't squawk--they're professionals.,Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
Thank you, sir. ,I'll take one. 
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?,Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.,Oh, yes. On the pier.
I'm going to the show--,I'll go with you--
I'll go with you.,Swell!
It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.,How about trying your fine Italian hand?
Don't get yourself all worked up--,You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?,Why, I--
Here's your fifty.,Thanks. That makes us square.
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.,Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
That's too bad.,I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.,Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Where do you live?,In New York.
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!,That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Your wife knows that, don't she?,Sure.
Now we get it down to two words--"next month.",Send that.
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!,Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
Hello, Denby!,I thought I put you to bed.
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.,<U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.,Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Maybe he just travels in bad company.,Yeah--
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.,Like it?
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?,No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--,Do what--
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.,I'll never love anybody else.
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?,Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.,Meaning what?
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?,All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
With your dry wit and humor--,Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
Well, he has a straw hat--,So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
Is that one of the Who's Who?,No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?,No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
I went for four.,It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
I wish I could.,Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
You leave the kid alone.,A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
Not because of Ned.,Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?,Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?,Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
No!,S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--,This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?,For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.,I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
There you are, sir.,Thank you.
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!,What's the matter?
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.,Sure, Sis.
I'll explain later--,If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?,Telegrams.
Nothin'.,Let me look at it.
Oh, for Christ's sake!,Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?,Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?,That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.,I don't understand.
He said to turn loose of him.,Well I'm not so go home.
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.,Come and get him.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?,This brand.
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.,I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
On three?  You call it.,Here it come: one-two-
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?,I was kidding about that.
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.,Say when.
Here, Doc.,Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
Not exactly...,I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Since when is faro a business?,Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
He's drunk.,In vino veritas.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.,But Doc-
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much,Sorry, sorry...
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God, I'm so sorry.,That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.,All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.,Then what do I do?
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".,What?
A which?,You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.
Don't touch me!,Sorry...
You really look awful.,Not half as bad as I feel.
I don't believe it.  He's clean!,What?  But I saw 'em-
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.,Good God, you're really-
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.,All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
Praise Jesus!,I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.,I laugh sometimes
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?,Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.,The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
What's wrong?,I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.
Always?,Getting late.  We better get back.
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.,Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...,I forgave you the moment you said it.
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.,Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
No, stay.  Please stay with me.,Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.,All right, well, good night.
Really?  You sure?,Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.,Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
Mattie.  What about this?,I need it.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-,You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!,McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!,All right, run 'em off.
Well how do we look?,Hey!  Virgil!  My God!  Morgan!  Hey, Boy!  You look great!  Both of you!
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.,Will somebody get the damn dog out-
That a fact?,Yeah.  It's a fact.
Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.,Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.,But she doted on the frowner
Well we're off and running.  Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental.,Acquired?
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.,I know, I need a keeper.
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream.,Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though...  Guess you better swear me in.
Why don't you just leave it alone?,No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
But -,- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?,I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?,36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.,I see.
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.,So why did you leave?
Briefly.,Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
I'm sure they will.,Good-bye, Mister Bond.
Q! How are you?,Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.,That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
Paris?!? What are you doing here?,Is that any way to say hello?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?,I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
Paris -,Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?,He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
Just - say it. Say it just once.,One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -,Not from forty feet.
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.,If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.,Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
They'd never sail this close to the shore.,Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
... Kids?,Three. You? Married?
No.,I didn't think so.
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.,Thanks.  Take care -
Bourbon. Neat.,I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
No?,No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
... Do you have a gun?,What?
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.,That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Not a lot of difference.,What do you mean?
What the hell does that do?,Cleans dirt. Let's go.
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.,... We have time for that?
Sometimes you just have to -,Don't say it.
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.,If not?
... Yes?,First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.,... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
... And what do you call these?,Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Sakwa!,Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
No.,You leave me no alternative.
The Queen invited you to dinner -,Yes -
How is it now?,Seems to be back to normal, sir.
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!,Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.,Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!,I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
What the hell is going on?,It's Bond!
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.,Thank you sir! Thank you!
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?,No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?,Yes.
When are you boys going to fix that roof?,Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.,This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.,I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.,My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.,Will you still get the money from your father?
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?,Why in the h...
I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.,Like a veil has been lifted?
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?,Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.,What for?
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?,I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.,You're going to find yourself on the floor.
I'm worn out.,Just stay in bed and rest.
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...,I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.,He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.,Well, I would appreciate that.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.,You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
Harry, you know everything.,You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
I hope that it's nothing serious.,He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.,You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.,You must have done something to her.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?,I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?,Now who are we talking about?
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?,Girl, do you still sing and dance?
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.,"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.,I already have, my dear.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.,Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
What must I do?,If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.,Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.,I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
What are you doing?,Counting the gray hairs in your head.
Can we leave this up 'til we move?,Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.,But Mom, I can't find him!
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!,Okay...
Can I help pump the gas?,Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
Right here in the van.,Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
Which one can I open first?,Let's let Molly open one.
What are you doing over there?,It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --,Excuse me.
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.,No, you can't.
Yes, I can.,You can't!
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!,You're mocking me, aren't you?
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!,Where?
Sure is a hairy fellah.,No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
I could have stopped him.,Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.,WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!,Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.,Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.,No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Woody!  It's the moving van.,We've got to get out of here...NOW.
Hold on, Woody!,I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!,Not today!
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!,Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!,I can't see a thing!
Ohhh!  You sunk it!,Heh-heh.
What?,Look!  Janie!
Hey!!,She's sick!
No she's NOT --,I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
MOM!!  MOM!!,She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.,Have you been replaced?
That ain't no happy child.,He tortures toys -- just for fun.
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.,Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!,Nothing.
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!,Toss 'im overboard!
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.,So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
There.,Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
Reach for the sky!!,Huh?
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!,I did like the music.
Is there anything else I should know about him?,Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.,Is that all?
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.,Go away.
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.,Well ... yes. All right. But -
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.,We're too young.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.,Juliet who?
I appreciate you coming in so early.,Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.,He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
Why does he need money?,He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
How much?,Nine thousand dollars.
Helena, I'm so sorry --,Arnie, thank God.
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?,You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
How much do I pay him?,I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.,Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?,It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?,I was just waiting for the right time.
So my wife is lying?,Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.,That's frustrating.
This is different.,Why?
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?,We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?,I don't know.
You all right?,I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --,How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?,Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.,You can't make me.
...How old are you?,Sixteen
Live with your parents?,Yes.
How are your grades?,I'm third in my class.
What's that mean?,I get A's.  All A's.
What are you doing?,Just watch.
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.,Have you done your homework, honey?
Yes, mom --,Then here's a little bump.
Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.,We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business.  We got you.
That's a big word for a fisherman.,Who do you work for?
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.,She ain't in on it.
What do we do?,I don't know.
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?,Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?,Depends on the state.
David --,We're playing!
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.,There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.,But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
You first.,I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
What's he doing up here?,I don't know.  Something.
Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?,Not this time.
You should feel good about this.,I feel like a traitor.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.,What is it you want me to do?
You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.,But will he be house-trained?
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.,Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?,That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
Oh, man --,She hasn't called you?
What?,The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.,Yes, I hope so as well.
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?,Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
Who do we interface with on their side?,What do you mean?
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --,It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --,You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.,You've stabbed me, man.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.,Can you not go yourself.
Buy yourself that island in the sun?,For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?,Eh-
What?,Out.
Jesus.,And don't make any noise.
I don't see why not.,Because it's illegal.
Can I see you again?,Certainly not.
Yes.,Is that a promise, then?
Well, it isn't.,Smells like it.
You're too young.,Too young for what?
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.,I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
What? Steady like?,That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.,What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.,Eh? How's that?
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.,Fuck, OK.
Do you recall the school motto?,Of course, the motto, the motto --
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.,Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.,Sorry about last night -
You take the test?,Aye.
Clear?,Aye.
That's nice.,I'm sorry, Tommy.
Thanks, Mark.,No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
But try too hard --,And you might get the fucking job.
Screenwriter?,Eh - Ian Fleming?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.,OK, so who was it, then?
I don't rate that at all.,Despite the Academy award?
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.,It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.,You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
Why would I want to sell my passport?,It was just an idea.
What?,There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
What was your price?,Four Grand.
The Sick Boy method.,Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.,As you wish.
There.,Are you serious?
It's the great outdoors.,It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
How's it going with Gail?,No joy yet.
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.',So what's it going to be?
A walk.,But where?
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?,No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
With a starship!,This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
It could. Yes.,Then I shall make use of this starship.
I couldn't help but notice you pain.,My pain?
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.,Raise shields.
This is the Starship Enterprise.,A Federation starship.
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.,Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
Can we have it quiet?,Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.,Oh, please.
No, but you can bet they will.,Understood. Kirk out.
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.,It's all I have.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?,Join my quest.
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.,I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.,If we could send a distress signal...
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.,Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.,I don't understand.
Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.,That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
Yes, Captain.,Goodnight, Bones.
Goodnight, Spock.,Goodnight, Doctor.
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.,Fascinating.
Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.,That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...,No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.,Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.,Why didn't you tell me this before?
What is this?,I believe we are witnessing my birth.
You are mad!,Am I? We'll see.
,
,  
,
,
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.,Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.,Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
Each man's pain is unique.,I hide no pain.
Are you embezzling?,"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
I don't get it.,You haven't told him?
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.,I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Hi, Alan.,Hi, Flynn.
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.,I know, I met him.
For what?,For being on to Dillinger.
They'll start to soon enough.,Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.,oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
That all you can say?,No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
Way to go! We're haulin'!,Yes, okay, exactement!
This town's full o' live ones.,Not a chance.
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?,I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.,If you think -
Well I want to communicate --,Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?,They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
Alan!,Where did you hear that name?
Well, isn't it -- ?,The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
How about over there...that empty memory?,No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.
Hey... you guys OK?,How about you?
There's another beam!,It's too far!
Flynn, we've got to help him!,Let's get some power here.
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.,Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.,How 'bout yourself?
Watch it!,Recognizers!
What's goin' on?,We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..,Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.,Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
But-what if I can't...?,You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.,Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
What do you think?,Do it!
Yori... hey...,Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.,Then I owe you some thanks...
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.,So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.,I'm shocked.
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.,Where are you going?
You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.,Okay, Dad.
How was school today?,Fine.
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?,Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.,You're kidding.
Probably because it sounds scary.				*,This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
Harry?  HARRY?!,What?
Thanks dear.,Here, check these out.
Fourteen, Harry.,Right.  She's only fourteen.
Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.,I thought you moved out.
There's another guy, still in the car.,Stay on him.
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --,Okay.  Here she comes.
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.,Son of a bitch!
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.,You want me to just hang-- ?
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.,Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.,Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?,Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
She could be telling the truth.,Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
Now what?,There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.,Why not?  You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?						*
He's got it.,Sorry.
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.,But you didn't.  Why not?
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.,Is that why you got into this business?
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.,And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Hello, Harry.,Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--,What'd you do, honey?
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.,It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
Uh huh.,My husband the hero.
Not because you were attracted to him?,No.
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.,Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...,What did you need?
Now slide the nylons off one by one.,I'm not wearing any.
17 years.,My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
No.  But I wanted to.,Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.,What?
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?,We must be in the Florida Keys .				* .  .  the Overseas Highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
Oh shit.,Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay?
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.,I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?,Absolutely.
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.,So what's your angle?
You working on someone right now?,I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?,He said he was an American agent.
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.,No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.,Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Are you sure you weren't followed?,I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.,I understand.
Worse than Cairo?							*,Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
Did you read the papers yesterday?,Yes.
You can trust me completely.,I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
What is it you want me to do?,Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
You'll call me then?,Yes.  Now go.
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.,I don't know.  I have to think...
You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.,It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
It's a good thing you pay me well.,Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
Did you get the letter?,What letter?
Not yet.,Nope.
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?,Knock wood.
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.,Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?
The forager's back.,Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.,What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Sonny kicks ass.,You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.,My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.,What time is it?
Well, enough about the King. How about you?,How 'bout me what?
Tell me about yourself.,There's nothing to tell.
What kinda music do you like?,Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
How long have you worked here?,Almost four years.
Do you get paid a lot?,That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
What's that?,That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.,I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.,What would make you think that?
She OD'd, didn't she?,Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
"Heroes For Sale"?,Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
Is he black?,He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
Yes.,You will?
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.,Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?,Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.,It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
What the fuck are you talkin' about?,Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
I'm hip.,In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun.
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?,Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
Yeah.,You wanna get unhaunted?
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.,I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
If I thought I could get away with it -,Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?,Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?,You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
Clarence sent a letter?,Has he gotten his mail today?
Money problems?,Now tell him goodbye.
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.,Good for you.
This shit can't be real.,It'll get ya high.
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?,Tell me.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.,Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Elliot what?,Elliot Blitzer.
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?,What's to think about?
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -,I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.
No. But thanks.,No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
I'd fuck Elvis.,Really?
What do you think, eightball?,The police department?
No. No, you don't.,Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.,Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
Well, I guess it's about that time.,I guess so. Follow me.
Don't you?,No.
What do you want from me?,What?
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.,Who is he?
What are you talkin' about?,I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.,Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?,I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Could we try it now?,Absolutely.
Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?,Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.
That Vietnam movie?,Uh-huh.
That was a good fuckin' movie.,Sure was.
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.,'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.,Pussy love pink rocks.
You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy.  I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.  He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?,Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.
You gotta hold this for me.,You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
How do you know? You been there?,No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
Yes.,Do you know where we can find him?
Wake up, Cole.,Uh, I didn't hear the...
No, sir!,We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
You said we weren't "real," Cole...,Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not.
To be determined by the proper authorities.,You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.,Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.,Shut up!
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?,No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
You're afraid of germs?,I have to go.
It's just a shot to calm you.,No more drugs.  Please...
You used to call me "James".,You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.,You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?,Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!
They're keeping an eye on me.,Who's keeping an eye on you?
You didn't have a gun before, did you?,I've got one now.
Mason???,Jeffrey Mason?
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.,What's the matter with your leg?
What made you think that?,Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.,I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.,James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
You want me to rob him?,I...I...We need cash, James.
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.,You... you left them a message?
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.,Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.,If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
Why are we doing this?,So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!,On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?,No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
What....???,Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.,I'm here about some monkeys.
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.,Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.,I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!,And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
Jo...Jose????,Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this.
This part isn't about the virus, is it?,Hey, man...
Uh, that message...me?,It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.,And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?,You're insane, Jeffrey.
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.,Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.,You can't do that yourself?
Maybe I do.,Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.,Think you'll live that long?
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.,Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
Nothing.,You want to make a kiddies bet?
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.,Hundred and eight already.
Can I help you, sir?,I need a ticket.
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.,How much.
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.,I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.,I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.
You want somethin'?,You Harlin?
Nope.  Darrell.,Harlin around?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?,'Cause Harlin used to own it.
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--,Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?,You've been there?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.,You believe that?
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.,You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.,I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
No!,What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.,It is morning.
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?,I want my car.
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?,You got beer?
What would a truck stop be without beer?,Let me have a Beck's.
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.,Genuine Draft?
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?,Yeah, give me the Miller.
Who was that on the phone?,Wrong number.
They look nice.,I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
Jake, what is that?,What does it look like?
Jesus.,You sure you can manage?
Wasn't nothing.,Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
A medicine man?,Those are white words, not ours.
My face tell you all that?,It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
All right, Grace.  No more games.,Games?
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.,If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
You love him?,No.
Did you ever?,Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.,How much money has he got?
Lied?  What do you mean?,I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
I don't think we have anything to talk about.,What about us?
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!,Don't yell at me!
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.,Where are you going?
To get my car.,Wait.  What about . . . him?
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.,Yeah.  Good thinking.
John . . .?,Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.,He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.,I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.,Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.,A lot that means.
I have half a mind to--,Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
What brings you to Sierra?,My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.,I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?,No.
Hungry?,No.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?,About what you said this morning.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.,I did?
I'm not rambling.,You're talking like a mad man.
I guess I might as well get this done with.,The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
The time wasn't right.,You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
Shut up.,Came close this time and it scares you.
Drop it, Jake.,And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?,Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.,No.
Yeah, well, me too.,Trouble with the car again?
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.,Darrell giving you problems?
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--,You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
I came for Grace.,You came to take my wife from me?
I came to kill her.,Liar.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.,Christ, Jake, please--
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.,What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
I asked you a question.,Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
I want to stay.,I said come on!
Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!,You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
For defending my honor this afternoon.,I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.,Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.,No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--
I wasn't hitting on your girl!,Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.,You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Now, what's this?,Give it to me!
John, what a surprise.  I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.,I know, Mr. Vesci.  I know.  I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had.  You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.,No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
You're the gambler.  You tell me.,I had to beat it before the cops showed up.  I don't have a cent to my name.  I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mr. Vesci, if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have any at all.  So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car.  I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.,A hundred-forty-five really.
Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.,Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . .
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.,No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.,Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Why don't you step out of the car, son?,I don't understand what the--
No police.,But, Senor--
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?,I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.,Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?,All right, old man.  Christ.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?,He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
Maybe I do.,Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?,I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.,So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
I wasn't doing anything.,That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Christ, I don't believe this!,Stand up.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!,Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
A lot that means.,Grace, tell him.
You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole!,You broke my nose!
What the fuck do you want?,I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
Say, what happened to your hand?,Accident.
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.,Like you don't know.
I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?,It's not what you think, Jake.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?,What are you talking about!
Two-hundred dollars?,Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll kill her!
What happened to your hand?,I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?,I've had time to get over it.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.,No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
Nothing.,Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.,Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
What the hell happened to my car?,Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.,How much!?
Hundred-fifty.,To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?,About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .,You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.,What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.,That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
Got any cold soda?,Eh?
I like that about me, beautiful.,It's Grace.
No, I've got it.,What happened to your hand?
Drove into Superior?  What for?,Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.,If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
A medicine man?,Those are white words, not ours.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?,I have an idea.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.,Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Doesn't the isolation bother you?,Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
You love him?,No.
Did you ever?,Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.,I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.,You could leave him.
You mean the Shaman?,He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
Where?,Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.,It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.,I thought you couldn't get your car.
Grace ... Grace?,After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.,Good thinking.  What's all this?
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.,Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.,He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
So, aren't you going to ask me?,Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
Why's that?,'Cause I love you.
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.,Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.,Which you don't have.
Out of here.,But, in particular?
One way, or round trip?,One way.
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?,Sure, I'll try.
Let me get your change.,Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Son of a bitch!,Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?,No baby, you got it wrong.
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!,...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
Help me, Grace, help...,Like you helped her, Jake?
I axed you a question.,Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?,What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
Once again please?,My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
Okay.,Do you remember me getting sick?
Is that what you wanted to ask me?,Yes.
I've come to a decision.,Oh.
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?,You use your sleeve.
Would you like to try going--,Yes.
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?,Seventy-five percent.
Just give me a minute.,Is there a problem?
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.,How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.,It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.,That's not what I witnessed David.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.,It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.,We are.
He's kind of a miracle.,Yes he is.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.,What's he look like?
Yeah?,There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.,What things?
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?,No.
How many did you put on that time?,All of it.
I know now.,Know what?
You like sports?,It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
You represent someone in Philadelphia?,I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
How are you feeling?,Okay.
Where were you sitting on the train?,Against a window.
...I got a present for you.,Why?
Well, go get it then.,Where is it?
She's gonna live.  She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.,No?
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.,Innocent of what?
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.,Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...,Your wife?
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.,Shit and fried eggs.
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?,Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...,Alive?
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...,Those cowboys messin' him up?
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.,You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Hit your finger, huh?,Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.,Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
Like I said, I...,What's your name?
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?,N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...,Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.,Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
He hanged him?  Shot him down?,N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?,About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
Then... what?,A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...,Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
Schofield? You from Schofield?,On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
About what?,Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.,Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?,What business?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.,Well... I don't recollect.
Get some sleep, Kid.,You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
Finish him, Ned.,He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
Say, Bill...,Yeah.
That was... the first one.,First one what?
Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.,H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
Wha... what f-for?,Lemmee see it.
You could have it. All of it.,I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.,Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.,A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?,Huh?
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?,Eleven.
How long you gonna be, Bill?,Two weeks, I guess.
Three ways?,Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
She gave me the evil eye.,It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.,You ain't like that no more.
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?,Beats the hell out of me.
IS THAT YOU, KID?,Why would the Kid shoot at us?
Jesus.,Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.
No.,What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
Easy, Bill.,I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?,The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?,Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
Did you... did you... ?,Did I what?
No... I meant...,What?
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.,Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...,I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.
Fuck you.,He's blind, for Chri...
We done that stuff.,Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
Keyser Soze,There's more.
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.,&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;,He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.,I'm having a stroke.
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.,Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
They want more time to think about investing.,Goddamnit.
I love you.,They ruined me tonight.
I know who he is.,I hope I didn't disturb you.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?,A glass of water would be nice.
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.,Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.,This whole thing was a shakedown.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.,The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
He's alright.,How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
Me too.,Did you hear what he just said?
What the hell do you want?,I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -,They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
I was out of line.,You okay?
How are they going to do it?,McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Three million?,Maybe more.
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.,Neither do we.
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.,You're lying.
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.,I shivved him.
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him',Tell him we'll meet.
What do you mean I can't see him?,The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.,Keaton was a piece of shit.
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.,That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.,I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?,No.
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.,I'm not a rat.
You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +,Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.,What lawyer?
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.,Wait a minute.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.,I don't.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?,Because he was my friend.
No...,Keaton was Keyser Soze
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.,THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.,All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
What are you doing here?,Mickey told me to come back to work.
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?,... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.,What does it mean?
Thank you.  When Debby...,Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Well, many reasons, actually...,Tell me one?
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.,That's right.
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?,No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?,No.
Orthopedics?,I'm just an M.D.
...of Anesthesiology?,`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
How old are you?,I am seventy-four years old.
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?,I'm on the staff of...
Mr. Concannon...?,Nothing further, your Honor.
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...,I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.,...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Just now...,Yes.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?,I...
I do.  Yes.,You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?,Hold on a second.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?,'Code Blue'...
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?,Well...
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...,That's what I'd planned to...
Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?,Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
I didn't do too well for you.,No, you did fine.
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...,Her doctors killed her.
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...,I understand.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?,To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
Who are you protecting, then?,Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?,I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...,I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
I could subpoena him if I had a week.,I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Is the Plaintiff ready?,Ready, your Honor.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.,What?
I object, your Honor...,Overruled...
This is Miss Costello...?,Yes.  Price...
I'm a lawyer.,My ex-husband was a lawyer.
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink?,I think I will.
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.,And are they going to get it?
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?,What...?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...,You're going to stay here...?
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.,You're talking like a drunk.
Not if you don't grow up...,If I don't 'grow up...'
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?,I'm going to help her.
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...,What?
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.,You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Admittance form is wrong.,Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.,You got a good memory, Franky.
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.,So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.,Oh shit, what's today?
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?,You use their witness.
That's right.,I think we tried that.  The case is over.
Are you with me...are you awake...?,Yeah.  I'm awake.
Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?,The Doctors.
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...',...one of the other nurses?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?,It's locked.
... I'm sure you do ...,But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
... I understand ...,My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
... I understand ...,... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.,I'm going to see you get that chance.
I just saw her.,In New York?
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.,How old is he?
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...,Yes.
One hour.,Yes.
It's a long road that has no turning.,That's for sure, Frank.
Dr. Towler...,Yes.
...they start again three minutes earlier...,We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
What happened in those three minutes...?,We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.,How'm I doing so far?
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?,Yes.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?,Me, too.
Like all this.,I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom.
How often does this happen?,More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.,Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.,Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
Nothing.,And when she goes to those places...
Why did she never tell her daughter?,Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.,What happened?
Just let me talk to you.,What about?
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.,You won't have to.
Judy Barton.,Who you are --
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --,-- and how you happen to be living here.
Then will you for me?,Dinner... and what else?
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.,I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.,No, Judy, you don't understand.
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!,Why?!
Will you, Judy?,I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.,Honest?
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.,But Scottie, you don't have to!
You want me to dress like her?,Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
I don't like it!,We'll take it! Will it fit?
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?,No, Ernie's is fine.
Why?,I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.,Take me away...
We're going up the tower.,You can't. You're afraid!
Dead. He'd broken her neck.,Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --,Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!,Your accident...
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?,I don't know... Switzerland?
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.,John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.,No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?,No... this is the first time for me, too.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!,Not at all, I enjoyed --
No.,Well... anywhere in particular?
Why did you jump?,No!
What do you remember?,A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
What else?,A grave...
Where?,I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
Don't leave me... stay with me...,All the time.
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...,Why? What's happened?
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!,No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
Why?,Let me go.
Where?,To the church, I must go there.
Let me go! Let me go!!,Madeleine!!
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.,Does she sleep here? Ever?
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.,I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!,What's tomorrow?
What do you mean?,What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.,It wasn't your fault.
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.,What a pleasant hobby.
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.,That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --,Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
The poor thing....,And she died...
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.,For what?
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!,I'll take you home.
I've told you enough.,Who's the guy, who's the wife?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.,Mmm, yeah, I guess...
Mm. Better.,Did you need it?
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.,Oh?
She died.,How?
Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.,How soon can it be altered?
She's fucking hot!,I need a drink.
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.,That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
What's that?,What did you say?
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.,You're interrupting a personal conversation.
This is pathetic.,You're pathetic.
Don't point at me.,You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
The hell I don't.,You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
More.,Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
Wait!,What?
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.,We can do this. We can get her out of here.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?,Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.,You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
Wait. Wait a minute.,What?
So that's what we're doing.,No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?,Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.,We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!,What does that mean?
Who? What are you talking about?,They're on me. They're smoking me out!
We'll be ready Adam.,I know you'll be.  Three hours.
That's one idea.,No...we want padded chairs...okay?
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.,Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
If anything ever happens to me...,I know...
No way.,It has to be done.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.,I don't think so.
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...,You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?,Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.,I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
What?,I'm with Tina. Is she there?
Okay. Hi.,So who's the lucky guy?
She's in there!,I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
I don't think so Boyd.,Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
But not tonight.,Not tonight.
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...,Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
He's right.,We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
What's goosed?,What is her disposition?
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.,That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
Call 911.,Shut up.
Oh God. This is insane.,What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.,I'm calling the police.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...,No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
Boyd...What have we done?,What did you ask me?
What?,What you just said. Say it again.
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.,I don't think that's such a good idea.
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.,What does that mean?
My what?,You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
Whatever you say Kojak.,I'm serious.
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.,You're sick.
The hell I did!,You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
Nope.,Moore?
False.,True.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.,They need leadership.
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?,Not really, no.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.,You said nobody would miss her.
We're goosed.,We're not goosed.
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.,How about my Fatburger?
Caterer?,Yes.
Why?,Why what?
Why did you forget the tent check?,I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
Charles Moore for instants.,You don't like Moore? Since when?
That's absurd.,I've seen it on television.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.,I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
Keith do not trivialize this.,I'm not. What's the problem?
Not padded ones.,So what do we do?
Will you please call the chair people?,I will.
Hello.,Hi.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?,I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Just a bit of organizing.,Nesting?
Where are you?,We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
This is our honeymoon.,After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house...
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.,We're not canceling.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.,I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?,Yeah. You.
What are you talking about?,Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!,What money?
He kept saying he was protected.,What does that mean?
I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...,You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
What?,If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
Just kills me...,I love you dad.
It means she's insecure.,About what?
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.,I just want her to be happy.
I'm not breathing right.,You're not breathing right?
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".,The wahoo?
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.,No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
The first day.,What?
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.,A move?
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.,Did he try to kiss you?
I guess.,I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?,I do.
...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...,...embarrassing, shameful...
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.,That's our plan.
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.,I don't think that's a good idea.
Where's the camera?,It's a present from my parents.
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?,To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.,I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.,You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
What do you mean?,Nothing. I didn't say anything.
Yes, it is.,Don't you ever see him?
Never.,How could anybody behave like that?
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...,Evil.
His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.,And this innocent child.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.,You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.,Yes, sir. Good night.
What will the lady say?,She won't even know.
Is it all right?,Yes.
If you wake first, wake me up.,What are you going to do?
What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.,You're happy, aren't you!
You see how much you like her?,That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
Me, rich? Come on!,There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.,Where's the dough?
You wouldn't be here otherwise.,These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
I don't know -- they've always been there.,That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
Well... is it so urgent?,If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.,I'm not like you, you have your wife.
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.,Do they worry you that much, then?
Are they going to work here too?,Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
Is she coming back?,No.
Are your parents alive?,Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!,Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
You cannot leave ...,Why not?
Why are you crying?,I'm afraid.
It's a very big one.,Very, very?
What's going on, Moncho?,This louse is looking for trouble.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...,The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.,I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?,When you are, miss.
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.,Ah! Pleased to meet you.
How do you feel?,I have a headache.
How did you see me?,From the terrace.
) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...,Can you tell us what's on the disc?
In English, please.,I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.,I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
Why would they be going there?,I don't know.
You all right?,Why'd.. .you pull me out?
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.,Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?,If you can catch him.
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.,You sonofabitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
I should have told him.,Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?,We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.
What's the assignment?,You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?,Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
Think you can do it?,Not from in here.
What did you find out?,Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
You know how much man power you're talking about?,You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.,Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
You embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?,The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
Coordinated by polymer neural net.,It feels so.. .real.
... and you get nanodeath.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.,Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.,What's wrong with Parker?
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.,Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
Should I have?,Think hard -- it'll come to you...
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!,I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
You catching my drift?,I think I understand what you have in mind...
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?,I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.,You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
Go to hell.,It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.,Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.,Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.,As a matter of fact, it is.
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...,You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
Which way?,Both.
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!,No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
See something?,I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
Can I ask you something?,You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
That's why I'm asking.,Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
You okay?,...I think so...You?
How's your pulse?,I couldn't tell you.
The symphony of collision...,The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you,Why's that?
You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!,My...secret.
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.,As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...,We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The <u>Bomb</u>, aaaand...

Mr. President, this is St...,Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...,...and...
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?,He's not fine.
Well, get on the phone, and <u>get</u> it...,You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"... 
<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.,But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...,He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
It won't hold.,All I need is the one day.
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.,I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
Twenty thousand dollars.,Yeah, I'm gonna have to go to L.A.
Tell, tell, tell me again.,....we landing?
Tell me again.,Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.,What's it gonna cost? 
But, but, but, "they" would find out.,Who would find out?
...you want us to go to War...,...that's the general idea.
Precisely.,What did Albania ever do to us?
Why is this putz on the air...,... they're checking the ratings...uh...
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.,Anything at the Airport?

I don't know anything!,Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?,Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?

Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...,Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.,My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.,Allright. Wait here...
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.,But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.,...Gordon.
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.,Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.,Excuse me.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.,I gather you're a decorator.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.,Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
What if I have a previous engagement?,Break it.
If I could have anything... this would almost do.,Yeah, almost...
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?,The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...,Get the hell out!
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.,Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.,You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!,You got it, G.G.
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...,No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
Are you prepared to put that in writing?,I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
Businessman?,Businessman!
But?,But he still has something Mark hasn't.
Anybody want another drink?,It's eleven forty-five let's go
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?,About what?  About us.
Weird and tiny huh?,Hi
Yes, I guess you're right,Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir,Thank you
Hello?,Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
Can I give her a message?,You don't happen to have the address do ya?
I hope you enjoyed your visit.,Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
Tony and China?,Vell.  Goodnight.
Oh that explains everything.,You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.,Who's is all this?
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.,Safety in numbers man.
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.,Hi there Sarah
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either,Sell my soul?
Can this be stopped?,Maybe before the event, never after.
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain,You guys are being real assholes
Do you have a scarf?,Hey.
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.,Do you really think so?
These are good.,Mm-hmm.
What?,Try to communicate with her somehow.
You think that'll help?,Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?,I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
No.,What do you think?  Guess.
How're you holding up?,Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
Well maybe your wife...,She isn't here.
When...when will she be back?,I don't know.
I've seen you.  From the window.,Is everything alright?
I wanted to apologize.,You do?
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...,And then you weren't there.
Would you like some iced tea?,Very much.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?,Um...sure.
You must think I'm pathetic.,No.  No, I don't.
You look a little old for a student.,I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.,You must have been very proud.
Wow.,This is...
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.,She's making this up.
She got it.  Turned it down.,I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...,Okay, I'm a little tender.
What is it?,Kambucha mushroom tea...
Seance.,Jody, no...
Telling you...,...no...no...no...
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.,Please.  That's all I need.
In the window.  Norman's at work.,I don't...
Sit down here.,Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
Mef?  What's Mef?,It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
Does Norman know?,Jody, she's alive.
Adamant?,Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
I'm a terrible friend.,No.
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.,Did he say that?
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?,I think three...
She's awake.,We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
It's today?,Yep.
Claire?,Three o'clock.
Whatcha reading?,Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
If you have to work...,No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
It's just us now.,I know.
Did you...,Shhh.
Claire...,I'd never be able to live with mysel--
I just wish you could have heard her.,Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.
Claire?,Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
Did you call the police?,No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.,What kind of whispering?
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.,I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
Yep.,Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
"...for my father.",I'm so sorry.
Get down!  He'll see.,What's going on, Claire?
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.,It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
See?,What am I looking at?
Dressed?,Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
What are you doing?,Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.,I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
What?,Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
Do I have everything?,Yep.
What?,Are you glad?  I'm glad.
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...,I felt you...looking through me...
You dropped a glass.,I...
The...,Yes.  The ghost.
Ow!,What's the matter?
It's too rough.,Since when?
I think she's starting to suspect something.,Who?
THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.,Who?
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...,How did she know where it was?
We have to get out of here.,It's alright.
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.,She's gone.
I know.,Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
:Would you stop it!,:Well, they are.
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?,:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
Are you alright...?  You look pale.,I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!,But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--,Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
A what...?,A spirit.  Perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!,What are you talk---
Rowan...,You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.,I want to see my mother.
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.,He made that quite clear, yes.
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.,I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
I beg your par---,When did she die...?
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -,I under5tand.  All the same
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -,I had you sent away.
Who the hel1 -,It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!,Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -,I'm tired.  I need to rest.
Eighty million doll --- ?,And this - if you decide to take the rest.
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.,She didn't feel them
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -,FAST.
uh - then he - be just -,He just went out like & light-
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.,Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
STOP!,Always loved you..
There is no one here but the dead.,Go away!  I don't want you here.
If that were true, I would not be here.,It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
A girl...?,It's too soon to know.
Do not tell me that!,I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
I know that you're evil.,I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!,But have I...?  Ever...?!
Harder...,Rowan...
They like you ------- kids.,I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
Harder...,Rowan...
you're very --- different.,I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.,You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.,He fools around with his patients too.
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?,It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.,Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
Why don't you let at do that...?,Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
I'm serious.  You don't -,Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
Stop it.,You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
Seems more like a year than a month.,Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.,God knows, I'm intriguing.
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -,What about you coming down here...?
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---,He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.,I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.,Let's see.
Everyone - this is Michael curry.,Hello..
Hey - you're bleeding.,Dropped it.
You look a little green.,Mm-hmmm...
Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore,Mm-hmm...
Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.,That's cause we're below sea level.
You alright...?,A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
Is he - is he gonna die...?,Lock the door.  Lock it
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?,I don't know.
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.,Go ahead.
Something's wrong with you.,Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
Hi.,Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---,It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?,That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
Wow...,If you like that type.
Rowan Mayfair.,Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?,You really love this guy...?
He's got great hands.,Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
We'd better get to work on the papers.,Papers...?
OH MY GAWD!,I'm sorry - I didn't think
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time,No - I've been abroad for a long time...
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?,Sure...
What's with all the locks - and hammering,It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't,Where do you kill them...
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of,my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed,Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
You've killed but you're not a killer,That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -
Tell me how it happened...,Why should I?
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?,It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
What's wrong?,Nothing could be better...
Where are you going?,Out - I may be some time
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot,No thanks - 
Why did you let him in?,What was I supposed to do?
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar,Why whats wrong with the sugar -
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...,You killed my friend!
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?,It's what you would do to me
Don't you want me now LESLIE,No - I'll have you after
What's wrong with you?,I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
Is LESLIE here?,No he had to - he's just - he's out...
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?,And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
That's good,I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...,Yes - of course.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.,Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.,Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Who the hell was your father?,Well, Dad said...
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?,This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.,I love those springy head puppies!
Get them together.,Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?,We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
You got everything you ever wanted.,Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
And I was wondering.,Yeah?
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?,SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
Son.,Well, why should I?
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.,Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.,Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.,I will not have my boys arguing.
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.,I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
Well?,I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?,We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.,But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?,Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.,Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.,Most places are, Jimmy.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.,So, what brings you here at his hour?
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.,My room?
Are they okay?,Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
I miss them, too.,You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
You're a peach.,Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
Great.,From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.,Me-ow.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.,I have absolutely no intention--
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?,Your article sucked.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.,I'm trying to help.
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.,I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
She said peanuts, you cretin.,You never know around here.
Don't write that part.,Is this an gritty expos or a candy ass press release?
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.,Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.,There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.,Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
That's probably my office.,Well? Where the hell are you?
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.,I'm trembling with excitement.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.,You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Do you trust me, Julie?,Not a chance.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?,You're quick. I like that.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.,I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?,I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?,No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
You promise you'll finish school?,I'll make you very proud.
You don't have to work another day in your lives.,But how would we pay our bills?
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?,Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.,Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.,Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
You called the cops on us?,Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?,Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?,As much as possible.
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.,I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.,YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.,Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.,My parents always say hard work builds character.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty.",You think we should be more open minded?
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.,That's perfect.
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.,Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
Are you familiar with "Heaven?",I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
She's going to wash your Jeep?,Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
How soon can we get something?,We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...,What about the blood?
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...,Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.,And the child...
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...,Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?,I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...,That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...,He was large?
Then what?,He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.,I'd like that.
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?,No.
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.,Suzie?
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?,All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.,Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?,The skinny brunette.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.,It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...,Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?,I net a guy in a bar.
Guess I kind of lost it there.,You could say that.
We all have...,I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.,The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
That bothers you?,Yeah, maybe, a little.
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.,We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
No.,So you were alone.
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.,And what do they say?
Are you crazy, Ray?,You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
Kelly's next, Gloria.,Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
A ride.  You want one?,Yeah.  But I got my bike.
It's those rocks, up there.,You and Suzie used to come out here together?
What are you looking at?,Nothing.
Is there some reason why you're here?,Curiosity, I guess.
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.,You're out of your mind.
Okay, what's the matter?,You notice my new jumper?
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.,Where, the mall?
Don't forget the car wash.,I won't.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.,In back of the garage.
So, where you off to now?,Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Kelly...,Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...,Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...,Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
Good thinking.,You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Can't you take that stupid thing off?,Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.,Just like that?
Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?,I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
Sam, for godsake.,Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
Yes.,And she wanted to talk.
Yes.,But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?,Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
But I..,Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?,We?
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.,I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
No.,Shit. Here we go again.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.,Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?,Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.,Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.,Starting with a screw?
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.,Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
What was all that back there?,All what?
All that jumping and kicking.,That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.,And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
At least I tried something.,Hey, I tried the board.
Jim, are you all right?,No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Well... that, too.,Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
They're so precious when they're asleep.,You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
Are those just button buttons or...?,Of course not.
My God!  He's so excessive!,Where have you been?
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!,Oh, I see, an easy plan!
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!,He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.,I'm sure we will.
A new friend?,We'll see.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.,Fine, I'll stop.
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.,Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
French?,Yes sir.
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...,A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.,That'll be all, boys.
Good work.  Really.,This is Colonel Richards.
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.,No, sir... just a businessman.
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.,Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.,Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
The first.,Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Are you all right?,For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
Now it's a bomb.,It is?
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.,Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.,Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?,Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
Willow Ufgood.,Yes...?
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.,Me?
Sir!  I have to talk to you.,Not today, Willow.
I can't.,Why not?
Gawd...you're...beautiful...,You're not a woman.
I do what I'm told.,Too bad you're not more like your father.
Because it's true.,I don't believe you.
Sorsha.,Madmartigan.
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.,I have no family.
Who is that girl, anyway?,Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
Don't make me angry, Peck.,You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?,I hate this.
Where's the baby??,I thought you had her!
Dada, what's a daikini?,Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
You must learn magic.,That's all I ever wanted!
How am I gonna do that?,Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!,I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
But what am I gonna transform??,Me!
Oooh, this smells terrible.,That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
Patience, Willow.,Courage, Willow.
We gotta follow them.,Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.,Queen Cherlindrea?
This is not going well.,Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
Obviously.,Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.,Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company,Sorry. It's important.
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?,That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.,It's been a while.
Your hole is healed, then?,Pretty much.
Is it them?,It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
How reliable is this kid?,Oh, he's good.
So one of them got to him.,Maybe.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.,Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
Who else knows?,Just us.
Where are you taking us?,We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!,Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
What was that?,He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.,We do not go into your courts.
They kid a lot.,I would not be too sure.
Where are you taking us now?,Home.
Who are they?,The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Enjoying your reading?,Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
But Stoltzfus said...,I know what he said.
The... bullets?,Oh. The bullets.
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.,Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
We had some lemonade and he left.,A real fireball.
You know carpentry?,I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
Won him over just like that.,I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
You're so sure of that?,Aren't you? After today?
You're the first one he'll contact.,He's got my number.
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...,What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
Did you find him?,Not yet.
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.,He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie!
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.,Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him ,I don't know where he is.
Everything okay?,Yes, thank you very much.
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws ,We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.,Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?,I have committed no sin.
I will be the judge of that.,No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
She say where he is?,I don't think she knows.
Aunt Em!,Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --,Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!,Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --,Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --,No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!,Oh ....
Oh --,Goodbye, folks!
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.,Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!,Oh!
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!,All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Oh, please give me back my dog!,Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
Ahh!  Ah!,I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Run, Toto, run!,Catch him, you fool!
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.,Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.,But, how do I start for Emerald City?
Are you ready now?,Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Yes, I'm ready now.,Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home.",There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.,How did you guess?
Oh --,Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Oh --,Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Where do you want to be oiled first?,My mouth -- my mouth!
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.,Oh...
Oh --,All hollow.  Oh --
And bears!,What sort of an animal is that?
Can't that female take no for an answer?,Oh --
Oh! Something bit me, too!,Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.,You've had plenty of time already!
...yes.,Look -- it ticks!
Oh, my!,Lions and tigers and bears!
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.,No, but you tried to.
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.,And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?,Not nobody, not nohow!
Supposin' you met an elephant?,I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
Oh -- Oh, come on.,Huh?  What'd he say?
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.,I have so got brains.
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!,What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!,They would?
Oil can what?,Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
The other side....,Yes --- there.
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?,I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Real courage. That's what we want.,You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.,It did?
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.,Don't you start it, too!
Here --   Come on.,What was that?
Stop pushing!,Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! ,Hold still - hold still --
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.,Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Where do we go now?,Yeah.
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!,Don't push!
Quiet!,Ohhhhhh!
No, sir!,No, sir!
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!,Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Hey, Dorothy!,Dorothy!
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!,I can fairly hear my heart beating!
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!,Well, that's you all over.
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.,But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
...to Dorothy!,Oh --
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.,Makes her look even more innocent.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?,I was hoping you could tell me.
Zukovsky...,If I dont get to the Boa before he gets to Maidens Tower, M is dead.
Weve got to get out.,We cant.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It wont just be two weeks out of action.,I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
Its just a scratch.,James.  It wouldnt really be...
Old friend?,Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
Who told you to look at Elektras files?,I took the initiative.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.,Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
Revenge isnt so hard to fathom. Whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it.,Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.,Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Consider me ungrateful.,Its I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
Beautiful, isnt it?,Yes.
I met you at my fathers funeral.,Yes.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I dont want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Im not sure he knew that.,Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?,Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.,Always wanted to see the upper lines.
How did you survive?,I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  Ive never told anyone that.
Whats wrong with you?  Are you crazy?,A little. Does it matter? After all, whats the point of living if you cant feel alive?  Isnt that right, Elektra? Isnt that your motto?
I could have given you the world.,Not interested.
Know what happens when a man is strangled?,Elektra, its not too late.  Eight million people neednt die.
See?  Youre upsetting my customers. What do you want?,How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.,Where did you get this?
Perhaps this isnt the time...,Please.
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.,Your father...
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.,How would you know?
Do we have the range of Renards plane?,Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
What about our end?,Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.,The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
The bearer of bad news.,We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
What's your theory?,Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.,You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.,Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?,Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.,That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.,Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.,You're the only human being I care for.
Jon, where are we?,Veidts complex.
Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?,I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .,The missing scientists.
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.,What is it?  How does it work?
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.,Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .,Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --,No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.,I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?,I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.,Antarctica??
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.,What are you up to?
Dan, is this -- is this New York??,Those cars.  What year is this??
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.,Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
What new information?,Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.,Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.,Coward.  Giving up.
What happened?,The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
What caused it?,Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?,He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.,Adrian.  Its too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --,We should get back --  What?
I can fix it.,-- What?
Their real names, please.,I don't know their real names.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.,I don't know their real names!
Adrian.,Laurie!  Good to see you.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --,Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.,What is that ungodly smell?
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.,Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.,That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.,You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.,You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.,Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
Up yours.,Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.,That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?,My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.,I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.,Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys,We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...,The scum of the Earth.
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.,That's exactly why we need them.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.,He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
I was invited. What's your story?,I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?,Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.,You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?,Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.,I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
They tell me you're an American agent.,What are you talking about?
What are you doing with the Ivans?,I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
We can't leave now. We have to do something.,Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
Aren't you afraid?,A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
Did you do your homework?,If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
Where'd the damn truck go?!,Go to the water, it's that way!
You okay?,A piece of shrapnel hit me.
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.,It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.,You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
What are you doing?,It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.,Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.,They come in any other styles or colors?
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.,You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.,Here we go again.
Nice hops.,The corner. Anarchy 99.
Sorry, "dude".,What's the deal?
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?,He's a pretty good actor, though.
That's the guy.,This pizda? Never seen him before.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?,Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.,You wanna see my politics?
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.,How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.,Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.,... until he found tungsten.
Scott.. I -,I don't like him being here.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.,I won't light the cigars - how about that?
You should always work with a spotter.,He's busy right now.
What do you say?,Not interested.
He's uptight.,He takes his work seriously.
Logan, do you see this ring?,I've seen a lot of rings.
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?,Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?,Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
The intention of registration act -,INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
What is it you intend to do to me?,Let's just say, God works too slowly.
Now that's Magneto talking.,No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
How?,The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
You designed this yourself?,Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
I've found her, Westchester Mall.,I'll go.
Is it enough?,Enough for a test.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?,Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?,He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Yes, sir.,He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
MMMMM!  MMMMM!,Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
Darling!,Hello...?
Will you miss me?,Very....very!
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.,Oh, nice.
Darling!,Darling!
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.,It seems fine.
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.,Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?,You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!,Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.,I'm sure we will.
I thought you wanted to.,No.
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.,What wockers?
Home!,Home.
Did you see anyone else down here?,No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
What a filthy job!,Could be worse!
That's not bad.,Can you imagine that brain in this body?
Throw the second switch!,This guy means business.
You can't win 'em all.,But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.,You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.,Who are you talking to?
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.,I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
Original.,Give -- me -- your -- hand!
No, no!  That whole thing!,... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Thanks...for all your help.,That's what we're paid for.
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?,It's the only way.
Hello there.,MMMMMmmmmmmm.
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!,Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
What's that tune that you're playing,Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?,I'm not sure I...get your drift.
Inga, wake up!,What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?,Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Look, Doctor!,Well, this explains the music.
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.,And look at this, Doctor!
It wasn't me.,Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
Give him the sedative!,Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?,I see what you mean.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.,I know Frederick.
What?,I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
Yes, I have mine.,And I have mine.
No, not sound.,There must have been someone else down here then.
His what??,His schwanzstucker.
I'm getting tired.,Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.
Look how far we've come.,You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?,Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
What d'ya want to do to kill time?,Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
Another fifteen seconds to go.,Do Something!  Stall them!
Foooooood!,Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t,So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.,But will they make good use of them?
Your orders, Mr Vereker?,I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
