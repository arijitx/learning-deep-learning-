# Learning Resources for ML 
 
I'm taking my first formal ML course in my Masters which starts from the mathametical foundation of Machine Learning and Deep
Learning , Here I will keep adding all the resources that I studied and found helpful to learn foundation of Machine Learning . 

## 1 Prerequisites


##### 1.1 Linear Algebra and Probabilty Theory
